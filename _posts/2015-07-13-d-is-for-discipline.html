<div>Dear diary,</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EqoECqimF1c/VaQhrM_DxXI/AAAAAAAABpM/snuR7s60OKQ/s640/blogger-image--1607596493.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EqoECqimF1c/VaQhrM_DxXI/AAAAAAAABpM/snuR7s60OKQ/s640/blogger-image--1607596493.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div>Admiring people from a distance is something we humans do subconsciously. We admire them for different reasons; their attitude, beauty and even their level of discipline. We love the way they look focused, achieving milestones around them and breaking boundaries. Any human can break boundaries and achieve great milestones but it takes an extraordinary human to maintain that level of success.</div><div><br></div><div>The ability to train yourself to do something by controlling your behavior is known as self discipline. It takes inner strength and a lot of practice to become disciplined. It doesn't just arrive as a package at your doorstep, you have to work hard to earn the title. Just like a habit, self discipline has to be learnt. The following steps may help if you are willing to learn;</div><div><br></div><div><b><i>1. Set goals</i></b>; a goal is an aim or a desired result at the end of a certain period. When setting goals, make sure they are <b><i>SMART!</i></b></div><div><b>Specific</b>: Start with a particular goal and work towards achieving it.&nbsp;</div><div><b>Measurable</b>: the goals should be quantifiable, something you can look at and say you achieved something.</div><div><b>Attainable</b>: don't put your self in a corner by setting goals that you know are impossible</div><div><b>Realistic</b>: set goals that are real!</div><div><b>Time bound:</b> surround your goal with a time frame during which the goal must be achieved.</div><div><br></div><div><b><i>2. Accountability:</i></b> You need to be accountable to someone if you want to be self disciplined. Someone that can see beyond all the excuses you give yourself just to dignify your actions. It may be you colleague at work, a friend, someone you respect, any person other than yourself would do. By being accountable to someone, you've placed yourself in a situation where you can be put back on track if you go off.</div><div><br></div><div><i style="font-weight: bold;">3. Out of sight, out of mind; </i>this old saying is very relevant when learning to be self disciplined. Inasmuch as you have learnt the art of being disciplined, there's almost a 100% chance that you can have a relapse. To avoid this, you need to keep out of sight and mind things (e.g phones) and situations that you know would take you back to a past you no longer live in. You've been there before, you should be able to recognize the signs and avoid them.</div><div><br></div><div>Learning to be self disciplined can be quite frustrating. The few points I've listed above are guides and they would come in handy if you want to be self disciplined. You are learning a whole new attitude to life and it can be quite annoying. You'll feel terrible, angry and even want to quit but remember it's the end that justifies the means. The new you is going to break boundaries and do extraordinary things so you need to be excited about that.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>What other things do you think we need to put in place to achieve the self discipline status? Please share.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b><i>Live, learn, love.</i></b></div><div><br></div>
