Dear diary, how are you doing this fine morning? we are getting closer to the end of the year. How are your Christmas plans coming out? Have you started shopping? There's just something beautiful about Christmas and I can't help it. We are looking at the 14th letter of the alphabet today and it stands for Strength.

Strength is the quality or state of being physically strong. It is the ability to resist being moved or broken by a force. When we were much younger, we always looked at those guys with thick, shiny muscles as strong people. While that is enough strength to some people, to me it's not enough. Life can deal some very hard blows to your state of mind and that requires more than physical strength to withstand them.

People often wonder where inner strength comes from but the truth is that it has always been there. You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only option you have. You look back at all you have been through, no one knows your story like you do. Those things you thought that happened just so they could break you, well I have good news for you, they didn't. You are standing tall today stronger than you think, able to be strong for others, because you chose to rise up from it all. Some of us have been there for others, we have bore their pains, we have been strong for others but who will be strong for us? Inasmuch as you are a strong person now, the circle that is called life can be unfair sometimes and we all need someone to hold our hands or better still, just remind us of how strong we are when that time comes.

Strength is the quality that allows someone to deal with problems in a determined and effective way. Being strong helps you to face the issues of life in whatever form they present themselves. You have to be mentally, emotionally, spiritually and physically strong so you can stand firm against the forces that may come at you. You don't have to be a 100% in all of them, at least some level of strength in each aspect would prepare you for those dark times.

Being strong is not about wearing panties on tights and calling yourself Superman, you have to act the part. You need to be strong for yourself so you can be strong for others. Find your source of strength today, from your wealth of experience, from people that believe in you, from the things you believe in e.t.c. It's important you know where your strength comes from so you can always go back and replenish whenever you feel worn out. I know where my strength comes from, do you?

We are learning...
