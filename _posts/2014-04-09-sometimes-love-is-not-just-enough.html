<div>Dear diary,</div><div><br></div><div>It has been passed on from generation to generation that love conquers all. While this is true to an extent, sometimes love is not just enough reason for us to do some of the things we do.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZbXKiGnESkY/U0WfIqd9MCI/AAAAAAAAAxc/B9zhhBri-YA/s640/blogger-image--797663112.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZbXKiGnESkY/U0WfIqd9MCI/AAAAAAAAAxc/B9zhhBri-YA/s640/blogger-image--797663112.jpg"></a></div></div><br></div><div>Take for instance, a girl in a relationship with a man that hits her when he is angry or when she has done something wrong (that's usually the excuse they give). You know he beats women but still you walk into that marriage with both eyes open. You say that he loves you and will change after marriage, really?! You are 6 feet under now after he beat you to death and all you are left with is flowers by your grave side.</div><div><br></div><div>You are carrying the sickle cell trait and you are engaged to a fellow carrier. You are aware that this union may bring forth kids that will be sicklers, yet you go ahead because you are in love. Will you both remember "love" when you are shouting on yourselves in the hospital during another crises of your 9 year old child, blaming each for what could have been avoided?Sometimes love is not just enough.</div><div><br></div><div>She is the "I don't care type", never showed the slightest inkling of even being a home maker. She always reiterated the fact that she is not the take home to mama type but you believed she would change. Now you are lying on the hospital bed with hemi-paresis after you collapsed during one of your shouting bouts with her. Is it really worth it? You lived over 30 years of your life with no troubles and in 2 years you ended up in the hospital with paralysis. Is love really enough to walk downhill?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You are a workaholic. Momma raised you to work hard and save money. Suddenly, you meet Mr TDH that can't fend for himself and he is feeding off you. From hundreds, to thousands, to millions, to being in charge of one of your bank accounts. He has run away now with your money and all you have left is "love".&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7s4frJm36a8/U0WfEU8sMTI/AAAAAAAAAxU/ZujDFZ6Dm08/s640/blogger-image--813496805.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7s4frJm36a8/U0WfEU8sMTI/AAAAAAAAAxU/ZujDFZ6Dm08/s640/blogger-image--813496805.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div>Don't get it twisted, love is a beautiful thing. The butterflies in your tummy and the slow music playing in the background every time you see that person, is enough to make you go gaga. &nbsp;In the midst of all these, you need stay in touch with reality. The good book says Love your neighbor as you love yourself. I'm sure you love yourself enough not to inflict pain and torture upon yourself so why would you allow another person do so to you?</div><div><br></div><div>We are all susceptible to love and it can happen to anybody, anytime and anywhere. It is of utmost importance that we understand that love is not enough to make some of the decisions that we do. Sometimes we end up regretting them and had I known becomes the song.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Love is hopeful, it never loses faith. Remember that faith is shown by our &nbsp;actions. If you love someone that pummels you every time, you can give him space or even recommend him a psychologist that will walk him through it (if he is willing to change). These are some of the actions that show true love.</div><div><br></div><div>Love is not enough reason to turn a blind eye to all the glaring signs. In fact, it should be the reason why you look for such signs and try to correct them. If they cannot be corrected, love is not enough to just walk over them. If you truly love them, you'll let them go so nobody gets hurt at the end.</div><div><br></div><div>Don't take your heart on a journey without your brain. Love with your heart, think with your head.</div>
