Dear diary,

*“Giiiiiive, and it shall be given unto you,
good measure shaken together,
and running over (2x)”*

If you didn’t sing that song in Sunday school, then I think it’s time you go back for some lessons. Those words were drummed into my ears as a child and I grew up, well aware of what I ought to do. Something happened in church yesterday; I dressed up all ready for church, hit the road and even got to church quite early. I was happy in church that day and it showed in my dancing. I was grinning from ear to ear and was all smiles for anyone who cared to greet me. Time for thanksgiving came and as usual, I danced my way to the altar, only to find out that I left my purse at home. Safe to say I walked back soberly to my seat. After the benediction, I hurriedly went back to the car because I didn’t feel up for the usual *meet 'n' greet*. As I settled down in the car, this kid from nowhere taps the window saying *“aunty, food.”*. He held his tummy with his left hand and touched his mouth with his right, as if to lay emphasis on the message he was trying to pass across. It wasn’t my first time of being in such a situation but despite the fact that I left my purse at home, I still felt the strong urge to give him something. I started looking for what was not lost; I ransacked the car until I found some change and I gave it to him. The smile on his face was priceless. That smile melted my heart and gave me peace within.

The art of Giving is something that is learnt and not just acquired overnight. To give means to cause or allow something valued or needed to go to another person. Some of us have found this act difficult to carry out due to past experiences or incapabilities  (financial, emotional, mental e.t.c). After much observation, I’ll like to classify givers into 3 classes; those who give easily, those who give with restraints, those who don’t give at all.

**Those who give easily**; these ones are examples of the gold standard we ought to live by. It’s not a matter of wealth or poverty; these ones just give. I don’t know if it’s as a result of their upbringing or their religious belief but whatever it is, it's certainly working for them. They do not need a reason to give whenever they are asked, it's just who they are. Be it money, time or love, these ones are always ready to give as long as they have.

**Those who give with restraints**; These group of people are givers but not until they have a reason to. Most times, they have a number of excuses for not giving such as *"I don't have change, I don't want people to see me give, what if I turn to a goat after giving him this money?"* and many other ridiculous reasons that seem reasonable at the time. It's only when these excuses have been reasoned out that they can now give. The thing about these category of people is that most times, they end up not giving because it's only a matter of time before the beggar moves on to another person. Then they blame the beggar, *"I was going to give him, but he went away".*

**Those who don't give at all**; don't be too quick to judge these group of people. They may have in the past, belonged to one of the above groups but one bad experience or the other, has helped them to conclude. You don't even have to tell them anything, just walk up to them and they are already shaking their heads in the negative. For some, its just who they are. They grew up to be like that and they don't see anything wrong with it; Palms so tight fisted, you wonder if they'll ever open up to give. If you ever come across people like that, it may help if you try to talk to them. It doesn't hurt to help them see that there's another way to life other than this *aka-gum* life.                 

Everyday, we come across at least 1 member of each of these groups. It may be in our work place, market or even our homes. Relating with members of the last group may be difficult at first but who knows, your good will may rub off on them. Find out where you belong and make the necessary amends (if any) to your lifestyle. There is this peace that comes with giving and it'll be nice to experience it once in a while.

Even the good book encourages us to do so;
*"It is more blessed to give than to receive"*
*"For its in giving that we receive"*

We are learning.
