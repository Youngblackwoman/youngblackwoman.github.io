You are still tuned in to 94.3  Stehllar Fm Lagos and it’s still the show  “RISING STARS”. In the studio  with me is fast rising act and the voice behind the hit song “It’s my  time”.   —————&gt;Raydon-G *applause*. We are going to be asking him a  lot of questions this morning because we want to feel his pulse, we want  to know what makes him tick. So feel free to call in and ask any  question, the phone numbers are 01-2712943 and 01-2713943. Here we go!<br /> <br />OAP: Good morning Raydon-G. How are you              today?<br /> <br />Raydon-G: I’m good. I’m really happy to be here this morning.<br /> <br />OAP: yay!!!… That’s cool.<br /><br /> Raydon-G: yeah… Yeah. *smiles*<br /><br /> OAP: hmmm…..so let’s start from your   identity. Your name sounds weird, how did you come about it?<br /> <br />Raydon-G: yeah…people tell me that all the time.<br /> <br />OAP: oh yeah?<br /> <br />Raydon-G: yeah….everywhere I go, they ask me the same question. <br /> <br />OAP: so let’s hear the story.<br /> <br />Raydon-G: well I got the name in high school from a couple of  classmates. Then I always liked to sing like the late ray charles and so  I was called Ray. Initially it was “don ray”, but everyone was  “don-something” those days so I decided to reverse it and that’s how I  Got the name.<br /> <br />OAP: ha ha….”Everyone was don-something”, Alright that’s cool. The “G” part??<br /> <br />Raydon-G: yeah, its from my name Gabriel.<br /> <br />OAP: okay… So what’s your full name?<br /> <br />Raydon-G: my name is Gabriel Coker<br /> <br />OAP: let me guess, you are from Lagos?<br /> <br />Raydon-G: yes I am…. How did you know??<br /> <br />OAP: well most people I know from Lagos bear such english names like  that as surnames. You guys have names like williams, baker, johnson and  the likes.<br /> <br />Raydon-G: ha ha…. That’s true.<br /> <br />OAP: someone said it has to do with the colonization  era.<br /> <br />Raydon-G: yeah, I guess so.<br /> <br />OAP: Alright now….let’s get to your music. When did music start for you when did you discover your talent?<br /> <br />Raydon-G: *clears throat*….. Well music started for me way back when I was a little kid.<br /> <br />OAP: really??<br /> <br />Raydon-G: yes. My mum even told me that I had been singing right FROM  THE WOMB, that she felt me singing in her womb even as she carried  me…………………………<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />By this time yours truly had stopped listening. He was still  talking but all I could see were his lips moving. There’s so much a man  can take but this is the height of it all. I mean…… “Singing from the  womb??!? Did you use your placenta as a microphone or guitar??!”… I was  asking myself as he kept talking. <br /> <br /><br />(Welcome to stehllar’s SUBCONSCIOUS…let’s discuss)<br /><br />A lot of artists, actors, dancers these days claim to have had their  talent from the womb. Its now becoming synonymous with their success.  When they become successful they say they’ve had the talent from the  womb but when they are yet to make it, they tell you their life history  and how they are struggling to get to the top.<br /> <br />The phrase “……from the womb” has been over-flogged, beaten and  dragged. Why would you tell me that you have had a particular talent  from the womb? It just doesn’t add up. As a neonate (new born), the only  thing you can do is cry, your eyes are not even open yet!. So if you  call “crying”, “singing” that partly explains why you are still  struggling to make it.<br /> <br />As a child you may have an innate ability or likeness for a  particular thing but having this “likeness” does not guarantee that you  will succeed if you decide to make it a career. This is where terms like  NATURE and NURTURE come in. While NATURE refers to something that you  came to this world with, something that is already in you, NURTURE  refers to act of growing something so it can mature.  Mother nature has  blessed us all with an innate ability but it takes nurturing on our part  as individuals to make sure that it grows to be successful. <br /> &nbsp;The fact that you have an inbuilt love for an art means nothing if  you do not grow and develop it. You have to challenge your talent, feed  it and nourish it so that it does not die of MALNUTRITION.<br /><br />Someone once said ——-&gt;”CREATIVITY IS LIKE A FART, U CANT FORCE IT  WHEN IT’S NOT THERE, NEITHER CAN U HIDE IT WHEN U GOT IT”…….hahaha, need  I say more???<br /> <br /><br /><br />GRACIAS. <br /><a href="http://stehllar.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/create.jpg"><br /></a>
