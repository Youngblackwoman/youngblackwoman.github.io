Dear diary, the series has finally come to an end. When i started this series last year, the aim of it was to give everyone an opportunity to find themselves with these personal development values. Each letter of the alphabet was used to describe a certain value that'll aid to broaden our perspective on life. Below is a list of the values we discussed:

[A is for Attitude](http://thediaryofayoungblackwoman.com/2015/06/08/a-is-for-attitude.html)

[B is for Beauty](http://thediaryofayoungblackwoman.com/2015/06/10-b-is-for-beauty.html)

There you have it ladies and gentlemen of the diary. It's a new way to teach everyone (both young and old) the letters of the alphabet. Instead of the regular a is for apple, b is for ball, we can now teach our children values to live by. I hope you have learnt one or two things from this series. Which of the letters was your favorite? Please let me know in the comment section. Now you can share this post with others so we can begin to change our society for the better.

**Live, Learn and love.**


*P.S: Regular posts resume immediately, plus I cannot wait to reveal the next series to you. You'll love it.*
