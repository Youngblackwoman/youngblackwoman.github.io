Dear diary, how are you doing today? we are gradually getting to the end of this series and I hope you are gaining a lot from it. The letter P stands for purpose and we would be addressing it as it concerns us. Ever questioned the reason for your existence? Have you ever wondered why you were placed on this earth? It's okay to ask these questions now and then, they help us to understand ourselves better.

Purpose is the aim or goal of a person; what a person is trying to do or become, it is the reason why something is done. We are all placed on earth to achieve a particular aim, each aim is unique to a particular person. We all have a purpose and destiny upon our lives whether we choose to acknowledge it or not. When you understand your purpose, there is a renewed hope and strength to fulfill it.

*"If the purpose of a thing is not known, abuse is inevitable".*

To fulfill purpose here on earth, a number of things must be done.
* Identify yourself: know who you are, your strengths and weaknesses. Understand your person because you are the only one that can do that.
* Speak positively: learn to talk positively about issues that concern you. From time to time, negative thoughts may want to take over your heart but think on the prize ahead and remain focused. Watch what you say and speak positively into your life.
* Prayer: the importance of prayer can never be over-emphasized. There's no better person to talk to about fulfilling purpose than the one who created you.
* Write down your plan: sometimes, the human mind needs to be constantly reminded of what needs to be done. write down your goals and how you intend to achieve them.
* Review your goals: the goals should be reviewed from time to time so as to monitor the progress made and also identify better ways of achieving your aim.
* Have a grateful heart: be thankful for where you are at the moment, where you are coming from and where you are going to.

I've always believed that each and everyone of us has a particular mission on this earth and the earlier we discover our purpose, the better. Please don't waste time waiting for someone to tell you what to do, get to work and search your heart thoroughly. Do not live an empty life here on earth, take responsibilty and fulfill that which you were sent here to do.
