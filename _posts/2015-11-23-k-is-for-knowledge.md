Dear diary, how are you doing today? I woke up this morning grinning from ear to ear as I relished the memories of last night (get your mind out of the gutter). I would love to share bits from it with you but there isn't enough time for that today. Today, we are here to talk about gaining Knowledge. We've made progress with the alphabetical series and I hope you are not just reading and throwing the lessons away. You should strive to act on anyone you are defaulting in afterall, we are all here to learn.

Yesterday, i tried signing up for *iTunes Connect* on my phone and before i could go ahead, they asked me to *agree* to their terms and conditions. As usual, i scrolled as fast as possible to the end without reading it and clicked the *accept* button. I would normally be ashamed of telling you guys about it but I know that I'm not the only one guilty of this act. Why do we always do that? I guess it's because it's usually too long to read and *a'int nobody got time for that.* Let's paint another scenario now shall we?. After my photo-shoot last year for *[Almost a bride](http://thediaryofayoungblackwoman.com/2014/11/10/almost-bride-all-episodes.html)*, an old friend of mine saw one of the pictures which had a lot of books on a table. He was very surprised when I told him that I had read most of the books there. People often ask me why I read and I believe this post will do justice to that question. I read to gain knowledge about things I don't know and to gain even more knowledge about the things I know.

Knowledge is information, understanding, or skill that you get from experience or education. It is the state of being aware of something. According to *Aristotle*, all men by nature desire knowledge but how come that isn't what is obtained in this part of the world? Most people in other parts of the world like to read, they question the norm; why are things like this? why are things done this way? there's always one research or the other going on in every field of study but on this side, its different. Ever heard the phrase, *"if you want to hide something from a black man, put it in a book"?* I felt very sad, the first time I heard it but there is some level of truth in it. How many of us here, take time out to read? I'm not talking about school books (it's mandatory to read those), I mean journals, *terms and conditions* fiction, articles, e.t.c. Yeah, that's what I thought, very few people.

We are no longer in the stone age where it was difficult to find books to read, this is the age of information. There are books everywhere today, even on our mobile phones. Contrary to popular opinion, it's not a *waste of money* to bring out money from your pocket and buy a book, rather it's an investment in yourself. Read one book at a time and you'll see yourself blossom with knowledge. I was raised by a man who taught the 9 year old me to read about *Gunner Asch* (you should try reading the series, you'll love it). It didn't make sense then to sit down in one place and read a book but today, I'm thankful for that opportunity. I have gained knowledge about things i haven't seen just by reading about them. Reading can become a habit if you want it to. Just like every other habit, it requires a lot of devotion to learn. Be consistent with it and it'll become a part of you. Don't get comfortable with knowing basic things, it doesn't hurt to know more.

I haven't written this post to spite anyone but to encourage us to constantly read and gain knowledge. There's no beauty in ignorance, read books and learn more. You don't have to start carrying voluminous books around just to show people that you are *reading*, you can start by reading newspapers, novels, inspirational books, online articles e.t.c. Read about inventions and research going on in the world. Reading helps you to gain knowledge that'll be used to develop your imagination. Register for courses and become better at your game; no one likes a *plain jane*, there should be something *extra* about you. It doesn't matter if you are reading about it or watching it in a video, as long as you are learning more about a subject, you are gaining knowledge.

*To know that we know what we know, and to know that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge.* **-Nicolaus Copernicus**


We are learning...
