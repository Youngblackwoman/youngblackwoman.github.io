Dear Diary,&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Happy new year!!! It's ironic right, saying that on the last day of January. Well, it's never too late to start a new year. I believe that 2015 would be good to us all. The general elections are fast approaching and there's a lot of tension in the air. Yours truly has been watching it all from a distance and she decided to write a post about it. You determine how you'll feel when the elections are finally over. Right your wrongs now so you can smile when it's all over and have no regrets (whether your preferred candidate wins or not).&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">It's fiction and I hope you enjoy as you read.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">**************************************************</span></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8iYJ_XrQD_c/VMyWDyjXntI/AAAAAAAABZA/JyeXUEZZC9c/s640/blogger-image-684932819.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8iYJ_XrQD_c/VMyWDyjXntI/AAAAAAAABZA/JyeXUEZZC9c/s640/blogger-image-684932819.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div><div>The sun is shining through the curtains and I can barely look into it. Celebrations are still in the air following yesterday's election. It's funny how the day we anticipated for months has finally gone by. People are off to church to make the first service, surely there would be lots of thanksgiving today. Yesterday was valentine's day right? How could I have forgotten? Even <b><i>bae</i></b> couldn't call to tell me sweet nothing's. I can't blame him, we haven't even had time for ourselves lately. He is too engrossed in his pursuit for change and I on the other hand have no will to be involved. Politics found a way to nest itself in our relationship despite how much I tried to stop it. He wanted change and I wanted it too but we wanted it for totally different reasons. I love <b><i>bae</i></b> as much as he loves me, so I believe now that this cloud has passed over us, we'll get back together.</div><div><br></div><div>When I saw my consultant in a heated argument with a fellow customer at the bank the other day, I couldn't but pray harder for yesterday to come. I mean who could blame him? The rains came and we needed umbrellas to protect us but they didn't do much for us. Even the brooms we thought would be useful in sweeping the country clean has shown to be of almost inferior quality as the umbrella. Who manufactures these things <i>sef</i>? Is it too much to ask for more variants and even better quality of these materials? I'm tired of buying the same things year in, year out. Aren't you tired too? So don't blame me for wanting an ordinary Nigerian to win yesterday's poll. Any change is change <i>abi</i>?</div><div><br></div><div>Twitter was crazy yesterday as a number of us were at home on our keypads monitoring the election. Wait, you actually thought we were going to go out and vote? We don't even have our Permanent voters card to start with, talk less of going to stand under that hot sun. I don't need all that vitamin D in my system. Don't even think of given me that "be the change you desire" speech, did you go out to vote?</div><div><br></div><div>At least the walls would be free of photoshopped bills of men and women displaying their surreal dentition all in a bid to get votes. My ears would be free of radio jingles of politicians promising the heavens and the earth if I vote for them. I won't mind getting free wifi though, that guy has my heart already. I'm still skeptical about going out today you know. With all those threats that some people were making if their candidate lost, I don't want any form of injury to my beautiful face. Those who lost friendships that were dear to them all because of different political views, I hope you can look yourselves in the face and see how low you've sank. It's the morning after the election and we are still alive, do we drop our grudges against each other or maintain the status quo?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Look back from the beginning of the year till now and think of all the battles, the blood shed, the insults, the arguments and all that preceded yesterday's elections, were they worth it? The aspirants are still alive today and they are not particularly interested in knowing that some of their supporters died while protecting their interest.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It's a new day and we now have a president. I think that's all that matters. Iya kemi is downstairs frying her bean cake as usual, so I guess nothing has changed. It's just the day after valentines day. <b><i>Bae</i></b>, can I get my valentines gift now? Thanks.</div></div>
