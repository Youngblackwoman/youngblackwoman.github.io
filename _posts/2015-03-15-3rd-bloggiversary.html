Dear diary,<div><br></div><div>On March 15, 2012, I published my first post on this blog; The Man in the mirror. I was quite skeptical about what the response would be like until someone said to me 2 days later, "madam blogger, I like your post o" lol. 89 posts later and it's our <b><i>3rd Bloggiversary.</i></b> Thank you for reading my posts these past 3 years. Your comments (criticisms and words of encouragement) only made the blog better. I know the posts have not been as frequent as they ought to be in recent times but that would change in a little while. I hope to do more in the coming years, God willing.</div><div><br></div><div>Meanwhile, to celebrate this year's Bloggiversary is a poem titled, <i style="font-weight: bold;">A man for all seasons. </i>It's about a girl having different men in her life for all the wrong reasons. Enjoy!</div><div><br></div><div><b><i>A man for all seasons&nbsp;</i></b></div><div><b><i><br></i></b></div><div><b><i><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_NNBLmKlGpM/VQXaQCUPAEI/AAAAAAAABds/MN1XMYijDZg/s640/blogger-image--436596850.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_NNBLmKlGpM/VQXaQCUPAEI/AAAAAAAABds/MN1XMYijDZg/s640/blogger-image--436596850.jpg"></a></div></i></b></div><div><div><br></div><div>She has a man for attending family weddings</div><div>Another, for the annual thanksgivings&nbsp;</div><div>She tells whoever cares to hear, "he's my bestie!"</div><div>And they smile in pity for the guy in the friend zone&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>She needs a man to stand up for her;</div><div>To fight for her and to let her sit</div><div>She needs a man to sit down with her;</div><div>To remind her of her blue eyes and white teeth</div><div><br></div><div>She wants the man that others desire</div><div>Just so she could raise their jealous eyebrow</div><div>She knows it may end up in a quagmire&nbsp;</div><div>Who cares?
