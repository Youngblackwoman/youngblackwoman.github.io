<div>Dear diary,</div><div><br></div><div>Choosing a topic for letter C was quite tasking for me, I had to choose between charity and change. After much deliberation, I decided to stick with change.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eoc8Z7IY6_M/VZB5wKHyL2I/AAAAAAAABo0/Snh7-isFjqA/s640/blogger-image-798800658.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eoc8Z7IY6_M/VZB5wKHyL2I/AAAAAAAABo0/Snh7-isFjqA/s640/blogger-image-798800658.jpg"></a></div></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div>After a long deliberate break from watching the Kardashians, I recently decided to watch an episode and see what‚Äôs been happening with them. It was quite an emotional episode as some of the K sisters were in tears. Apparently, the man they had always taken as their father Bruce Jenner, was becoming a woman. In this particular episode, he was explaining to them about how he always wanted to come out of his shell (being a man) for so many years but he couldn‚Äôt because he wanted to be there for them as a father. He told them that he needed their support &nbsp;now that he wanted to become the woman he was born to be. The girls were crying but at the end of it all, they decided to support him. Not all of them understood his reasons but they had to accept it; their 66 year old father was going to be a woman and there was nothing they could do about it.</div><div><br></div><div>Moving from the status quo to something else is my own little way of describing Change. It may not be a huge difference from where you were but as long as you are not in that particular position or situation you were in before, that‚Äôs change.</div><div><br></div><div>Change may come in various forms; it may be positive or negative and that‚Äôs the unique thing about it. For the Kardashians, change has come and they have to accept it. The human mind has an undying thirst for change when it has been buried in a realm of static energy. We saw this thirst during the campaign for the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama and we also saw it during President Buhari‚Äôs campaign. There‚Äôs something exciting about change that makes people look forward to it even though they are not sure of what it may bring.</div><div><br></div><div>Isn‚Äôt it ironic that the only constant thing in life is change? For you to move forward in life, you have to change something. If you refuse change, you can‚Äôt move forward. The change you seek might not be what you get but as long as you have made an attempt to move, that‚Äôs a step forward. Mistakes may happen but be rest assured you‚Äôll learn from them. I‚Äôve met people who are terrified of change and honestly, you can‚Äôt help but feel sorry for them. The world doesn‚Äôt revolve around you and if you refuse to move forward, you will be left behind. Not every change is good but that‚Äôs where wisdom comes to play. As an adult, you should be able to sieve the wheat from the chaff.</div><div><br></div><div>People change and circumstances change but you have to live with it and move forward. If you are willing, you can choose the type of change you want. A lot of relationships are in a quagmire today and the story most times is the same; its either one person has changed or the other person has refused to change, if you are tired of how things are, why don‚Äôt you invoke the spirit of change in your relationship? I don‚Äôt mean you should change your partner but you can change your attitude to certain things and watch the wind of positive &nbsp;transformation whirl around you.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Change begins on the inside and manifests outwardly.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Don‚Äôt be afraid of change, try something new today üòä</span></div><div><br></div><div>I'll leave you with the words of a great poet, philosopher and author from ancient china;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; <i>"Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don‚Äôt resist them; that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality, let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.‚Äù-</i> <b>LAO TZU</b></div><div>&nbsp;</div>
