<div>Dear diary,</div><div><br></div><div>*insert Joey's voice* how you doing? ðŸ˜‰</div><div><br></div><div>It's been a while I wrote in the diary and it's because I couldn't find my pen (pen means a lot of things right now so feel free to go with whatever makes you happy). I've found the pen now and I'm ready to start writing again.&nbsp;</div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sQDmZaJd0XY/VXRDxnttclI/AAAAAAAABns/Yy7fz99TgLo/s640/blogger-image--1366420797.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sQDmZaJd0XY/VXRDxnttclI/AAAAAAAABns/Yy7fz99TgLo/s640/blogger-image--1366420797.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div>During my search for the pen, I discovered a lot things that I haven't discussed with you guys such as virtues, ideas and the likes. I've compiled a list of them and I'm going to be sharing them alphabetically.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The first post goes up tomorrow. Each letter of the alphabet would be used to discuss a word (or words) for each day. Don't worry, you're not in a kindergarten class. There would be 3 posts up every week. As usual, tell a friend to tell a friend to visit the diary, it promises to be interesting. We all would be learning something new.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Live, learn, love.</div>
