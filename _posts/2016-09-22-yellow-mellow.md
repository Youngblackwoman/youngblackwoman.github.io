Fellow Lagosians, how are you doing this fine Thursday morning?. It’s another episode of *Lagos na wah!* And I hope you are as excited as I am to read today’s post. Don’t try reading this post alone, it could be dangerous, invite your friends to come read along, it promises to be worth it.

There are so many things that define this beautiful city but only a few stand out. Have you heard about the Lagos *Danfo* before? It is a means by which many go about their daily hustle. It is one that is sure to be filled with drama, no matter how small. How can we talk about Lagos without that which virtually defines it? Almost everyone living in Lagos must have entered this bus at one point in their lives; not necessarily for the experience but maybe there was an emergency or fuel scarcity or just a random reason. Like the proper lagosian that I am, I have learnt a lot on these yellow buses and it’s my duty to share some of my experiences with you.

A typical *Danfo* in Lagos is a 14 (13??) seater yellow bus with black stripes made up of 3 rows, each one seating 4 passengers. You may be wondering why I’m querying the number of seats in the bus but the truth is that most times, the 14th seat is usually missing or has been replaced by a tiny wooden stool large enough to take one half of the gluteal region of a passenger. Unlike a regular vehicle that should have 2 side mirrors and a windscreen, the typical *Danfo* has one side mirror (beside the driver’s seat), one windscreen and a bus conductor on the right side, acting as a verbal side mirror (you’ll hear them shouting: *wole, wole, your side, owa l’egbe o*). One of the features of a *Danfo* that you can’t help but notice is the different posters on the seats and windows. I thought I had seen it all till I saw this picture, *Lagos na wah!*

A *Danfo* in lagos is one that brings people from all walks of life together for a short while. Though the moment in time is very limited, you’ll be amazed by the drama that could happen in that short bus ride. I remember coming back from a wedding one fine Saturday evening in Lagos with a couple of friends and we decided to board a *Danfo* to our destination. We sat in the first row of the bus (behind the driver) and literally had to bend our heads (duck) for the greater part of the long journey home. We voluntarily decided to give ourselves that punishment because of the degree of curses that were flying in the air between the driver and the passengers behind us. Apparently the driver had his wife beside him in the front and they were all *lovey dovey,* causing him to lose concentration on his driving (he almost got us killed a couple of times). I got home that day and just had to say a silent prayer, it was too much.

Apart from being a house of comedy, the Lagos *Danfo* can also serve as an informal learning institute for the masses. I boarded a 15 minutes bus ride yesterday and you won’t believe it, I got schooled on Athlete’s foot. I mean that’s a whole lecture in medical school but here I was in a *Danfo,* re-learning what I had learnt in class. The teacher for the day (lady who was battling with athletes foot) was narrating her experience with it to a friend she met in the *Danfo.* She defined it, gave a brief history, described the signs and symptoms, management options and prognosis of athlete’s foot. All of this happened in that 15 minutes bus ride. I was just smiling to myself as she continued to score points in my head.

With all these stories you have heard about the *Danfo* bus, u may not want to board it for any reason but if you ever change your mind and want to be part of the drama that is a Lagos *Danfo,* here are some tips to having a stress free bus ride:

- Enter with your change: please do not enter a *Danfo* bus with #1,000 note and expect peace of mind. The conductor will respond by either giving you *the look* or screaming at you as if you just stole his bread. Instead look for change before entering the bus or better still ask him if he has change before boarding the bus.

- Don’t sleep in the bus: this is a total no-no. It’s normal for us to feel tired after work or if we didn’t get enough sleep the night before but the *Danfo* is not the best place to complete your REM cycle. In your dream, you may be seeing a city with bright lights but you’ll just wake up to reality and find out that you are at Alagbado. Stay awake!

- Owa o! The *Danfo* bus is not a place to speak too much English. Words like alight, get down, stop here, bear no meaning to the bus drivers. Once you are five minutes away from you bustop, start calling your stop alongside *owa o!* e.g *Yaba, owa o! Under bridge, Owa!* If you keep quiet thinking that the conductor will remember your stop, my dear you better think twice.

- Guard your property: the *Danfo* bus is one that is open to all and sundry so you must be able to maintain a level of security consciousness. There are a lot of pick-pockets, thieves and ritualists that board these buses with regular people so you owe it to yourself to stay safe out there.


I hope this episode has enlightened you on the beauty that is the *Lagos Danfo*. I have learnt a lot about humans, characters and situations of life by just boarding these buses and I wouldn’t trade those experiences for anything in the world. Have you had any funny experience in a *Danfo* bus before? Please share I would love to hear from you.

*Eko o ni baje, O baje ti!*
