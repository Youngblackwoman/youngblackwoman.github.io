Dear diary,
I resisted the urge to talk about happiness so hard that you'll think I'm just a sadist. It's good to talk about happiness and it's pursuit but like I said at the beginning of this series, we would be looking at core issues that affect our everyday life. You really can't blame me for wanting to talk about health; it's importance in this day and age cannot be over-emphasized.

Registering at the clinic for the first time, some basic parameters must be checked. They include blood pressure, height and the *almighty* weight. Not a few people are quick to ask the nurse *"what do i weigh"*, as soon as they unmount the scale. It's something we all are conscious about, *subconsciously*. According to the World Health Organization, being healthy is not just the absence of a disease or infirmity but a complete state of physical, mental and social well being. Some individuals may appear physically healthy but a state of mental or social disarray wipes the slate clean.

Physical health relates to the body of a person. How we take care of our body will tell us how healthy we are, physically. Most people in this part of the world are workaholics; wake up at 4:00 am, skip breakfast, drive to work (insult and abuse any and everyone they meet in traffic), work in the office from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm (lunch between 1 to 2 pm, usually rice and it's *accesories* washed down with a *chilled bottle of mineral*.), get into traffic on the way home (most times eat dinner in traffic; usually the legendary beef sausage roll and another *chilled bottle of mineral* ), get home around 11:00 pm, get into bed and sleep until the alarm rings at 4:00 am again. Don't forget the snacks and *chilled bottle of mineral* taken in between meals. No specific time to rest or take time to allow the body to recuperate. The all popular *leave* is usually spent doing the same thing you are supposed to be running from, work!. No form of exercise or workout sessions are carried out. The story is always the same; from one car to another, from one elevator to another. This lifestyle usually begins around age 25 and is constant until the body starts obeying the law of *karma*. The dormant lifestyle you lived in your youthful days comes back to hunt you. All sorts of diseases start coming out of nowhwere; cancer, diabetes, heart problems and a host of others seem to like an aging body. Then drugs, surgeries and different kinds of therapies come to the rescue. Do you know the sad truth about it all? some of these *end-time* diseases could have been avoided.

I see a lot of young people like me eat all sorts with no apologies to anyone. If only we'll take time out to examine our lifestyle and the dangers it poses for us. Truth is that we know the dangers of these things but we choose to ignore and *hope* that we do not fall into such situations. Truth is, there is only so much that *hope* can do. Don't just sit down waiting for a disease to wear a cloak over your life, get up and become active. Take a closer look at your diet and lifestyle and make the necessary changes. Thankfully, you are reading this post in an Internet friendly era. Google (man's best friend), would be more than willing to help you if you desire change. If you can't decide if your diet is good or bad, a dietary chart can help. A *Dietary chart* is a timetable of some sort you draw up in your diary for a period of 7 days, stating the meals, drinks and snacks taken for a consecutive period. At the end of the 7 days, you can examine your dietary and make better choices so you an leave a healthy lifestyle. On keeping fit, you don't have to live in a gym to remain fit. A 15-30 minutes walk every day, can make a difference. Life is not difficult, do things one step at a time *(see what i did there? lol)* and watch them transform you.

According to helpguide.org; *people who are emotionally healthy are in control of their emotions and behavior. They're able to handle life's inevitable challenges, build strong relationships, and lead productive fulfilling lives. Mental and emotional health refers to the presence of positive characteristics such as; a sense of contentment, the ability to deal with stress and bounce back from adversity, the flexibility to learn a new thing and adapt to change, slef confidence and high self esteem, amongst others.* What more can i say? look within yourself and be truthful. No one deserves to take charge of your health other than you. Be content with what you have, learn new things and be confident. You are all you've got.

Being healthy cannot be traded for anything in this world. Ask the wealthy ones lying critically ill in the hospital. Being ill does not only affect you, it also affects the people around you especially your family members. Also think about the expenses that'll be made so you can live a quality life. All the money you made from *hustling* during your youthful days would now be used to pay hospitals bills, sad. Our creator took his time to craft unique bodies like ours and i think its only fair that we take care of it.

On a side note; anyone else notice the improvement in physical health in recent times? a lot of people are now seen jogging every Saturday morning in the city. Even more people are registering at the gym or with a fitness instructor. Although we know that most of them are doing it for a totally different reason other than being healthy, you cannot but admire the zeal and effort they put into keeping fit.

Check yourself before you wreck yourself.

We are learning.
