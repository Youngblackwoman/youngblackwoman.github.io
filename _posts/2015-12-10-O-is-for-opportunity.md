Dear diary, how are you doing today? it's Thursday already, #TGIF in a bit. We are talking about the 15th letter of the alphabet today and it stands for Opportunity. The week is almost over, what opportunities did you make use of this week? Did you fail to recognise them even when they stared you in the face? How do we avoid missing these opportunities in the nearest future? I hope we can answer these questions with this post.

An opportunity is an amount, time or a situation in which something can be done. It provides a good chance for advancement or progress. It doesn't always present itself in a way that we want it to but that's what it is, an opportunity. It may be in the middle of a problem but because you are too occupied with the problem, you may not see the opportunity that lies therein.

*"Even when opportunity knocks, a man still has to get up off his seat and open the door"* **-Anonymous.**

Sometimes, we may think we are not ready for the opportunity when it comes knocking but what if it never comes again?. Opportunity may come only once and when you miss it, it's gone forever. Whenever a problem arises, we should strive to maintain a positive mindset. That is a difficult task to carry out but if we must make progress, that's what we must do. Remember the popular half cup of water? well, lets look at it together. Do you think it's half full or half empty? it doesn't really matter, seize the opportunity and drink the water. There's no time to brood about a subject when you should be doing something about it. While you are still *contemplating*, someone else is acting on it. Time waits for no man, that's one of the characteristics that differentiates an ordinary person from an extra-ordinaryy person.

The year would be over in a few days, look back and identify some of the opportunities you missed. Doing this would help you identify better opportunities that would come in 2016. You may be afraid to seize the opportunity because of the risk involved but remember that the life you are living is also a risk, nothing is guaranteed. We should learn to do risk assessment (you learn it as you move on in life) and take calculated risks. If you think it isn't worth the risk, you can patiently wait for the next opportunity and seize it.

We are learning...
