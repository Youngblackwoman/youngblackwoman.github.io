In answering the questionnaires, we were to measure the waist and hip circumference in centimeters, weight in kilograms and height in meters. We had a good laugh because of the surprises that kept springing up. I always knew that boys and girls differed in size (because of "endowments" and the rest...lol) &nbsp;but the figures I was hearing were shocking. Some boys had hip measurement of 35cm while some ladies were having about 100cm. We also calculated our BMI (Body mass index) and WHR ( waist-hip ratio). At the end of it all, some people found out that they were overweight and on their way to the fat city (obesity) while others discovered that being underweight isn't exactly&nbsp;"cool".<br><div><br></div><div>The body mass index (BMI), or Quetelet index, is a measure for human body shape and fat based on an individual's mass (kg) and height (m). It is defined as the individual's body mass divided by the square of their height with the value universally being given in units of kg/m2.&nbsp;<span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(175, 192, 227, 0.230469); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(77, 128, 180, 0.230469); -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);">When you calculate the BMI (body Maas index) and you are overweight (25.00-29.99) it's a signal to start work outs. The safe range is between 18.5-24.9. By the time you reach a BMI value of 30.00 or more, just know that you have reached the fat city (obesity) and its time to run!!!.</span></div><div><br></div><div>The Waist circumference is also important. To measure your waist, take a tape round your navel (belly button) and note the value. Normal waist circumference should not be greater than 88cm (35 inches) in women and 102cm (40 inches) in men. However, increase in your waist circumference also increases your risk of cardiovascular disease. The neck circumference is about 2 times that of the waist and that's why ladies prefer to test a new cloth around their neck when shopping at the market. Also calculate your waist to hip ratio (WHR). Abdominal obesity is defined as WHR greater than 0.90 in males and 0.85 in females. Are you in that category? Then it's time to run from the fat city. There's no time to feel ashamed or depressed. It's time to work it out.</div></div><div><br></div><div>Inasmuch as being underweight is cool to an extent, you may need some form of weight during pregnancy to avoid complications. Research has also proven that skinny people tend to have more fat in the blood hence the warning "&nbsp;Fat stored internally is worse than fat stored under the skin". In essence eat moderately at least to add a little weight.</div><div><br></div><div>Running from the fat city requires consistency, determination and courage (CDC). People advice all sorts from eating more water (i.e water melon, oranges and pineapple) to doing the sit ups but non of these can work without CDC. Do remember that it is all a function of time. Keep records daily of your achievements and you'll see progress.</div><div><br></div><div>Don't forget the best form of workout when you want to lose weight is thus:&nbsp;</div><div>Sit upright with your back against the chair. Then turn your head first to the left and then to the right. Do this every time you are offered food that will send you to the fat city... Lol.</div><div><br></div><div>Comments!!!!!</div>
