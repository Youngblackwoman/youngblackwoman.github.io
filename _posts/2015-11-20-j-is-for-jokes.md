Today we are going to be talking about something that makes us all burst out in laughter while displaying our teeth complement-Jokes.  What exactly is a Joke and why do we need to talk about it? A joke is something said or done to cause laughter. It may be a story or a demonstration but the goal to be achieved is laughter. This topic is on the blog today, all thanks to an argument I witnessed some days ago; a lady was screaming at her girlfriend who innocently played a prank on her. The prank was done to lighten her mood but *baby girl* didn’t take it lightly, *“don’t you ever play that kind of joke on me! I don’t like jokes”.*

My little experience on earth has shown me 2 kinds of people when it comes to the issue of jokes; those who love jokes and those who don’t. One common thing about both groups of people is that when the joke is on you, it’s no longer funny.  As a well grounded alumnus of both schools of thought, I feel I can say one or two things about the 2 scenarios.

I have come to understand that there are actually people in this world who don’t like jokes. I used to belong to this group during my teenage years. People that belong to this category, walk about with their noses high up in the air and straight faces. They look like they are carrying all the problems in the world on their shoulders.  Now these are the people that comedians dread, I mean it’s bad business for them. You try all your best to make them laugh and they don’t even move a muscle. At some point they start to get angry, taking it to another level like *baby girl* up there. If you take a well detailed history of this kind of people, you’ll find out that life must have really dealt them a hard blow and so there was really no reason to joke around while growing up. On the other hand, maybe it’s a defense mechanism so people don’t see them as weaklings. All that energy just to contort your face, it can’t be easy. Lighten up and be free. Life is always going to throw some lemons at you; it’s your decision to make, what you do with them.

The other group of people love to laugh. It’s either they are the ones cracking the jokes or they are listening to comedians do their work. It’s not like they don’t have their own fair share of problems to deal with but they have decided to rise above such situations. They laugh away the pain most times so that they can go back to the drawing board to restrategize. I slowly began to subscribe to this school of thought as I grew older in life. It has helped me to look at the brighter side of things. You begin to appreciate life better because truthfully, things could be worse than they already are.  It seems like most Nigerians are on this side of the divide; despite the problems that we may face every now and then, there is always a reason to laugh about it.

Inasmuch as Jokes are good for the body and soul, they can be expensive sometimes. Yes, the goal is to make people happy but we should be able to read their moods and know when to back off. Learn to respect your friends and know when to give them space. You may mean well for them but your actions at that particular point in time are doing more harm than good. Learn to draw the line.

Meanwhile it’s Friday, cheer someone up with a joke today. Laughter is the best medicine.

We are learning…
