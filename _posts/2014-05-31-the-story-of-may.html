<div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Dear Diary,</span></div><div><br></div><div>"Where do weary hearts go?"</div><div><br></div><div>Following the abducted 234 girls from Chibok, protests started the month of May. The protests took part in different parts of the country. The police that swore to protect citizens were using teargas to scare away peaceful protesters in some areas.</div><div><br></div><div>Just when we thought things couldn't get any worse, another blast happened. On workers day, jabi park in Nyanya was bombed leaving several people dead. This blast happened 3 weeks after the Nyanya motor park blast in April that we were yet to recover from.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Z5Hz3PAfVPk/U4tuTbdZc2I/AAAAAAAAA3w/ORenA9dogxY/s640/blogger-image-936147329.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Z5Hz3PAfVPk/U4tuTbdZc2I/AAAAAAAAA3w/ORenA9dogxY/s640/blogger-image-936147329.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div>#BringBackOurGirls is now worldwide. The spotlight is on Nigeria but it's all for the wrong reasons. The first 10 days in May were hot, protests left, right and center. Isha Sesay and other correspondents from the international media came into Nigeria to carry out investigative journalism In every sense of the word. Other countries like the Uk, US and France have offered to help nigeria.</div><div><br></div><div>B'Haram released a video showing the kidnapped girls covered with hijab, praying. They claimed they have converted them to Islam and they will only be released if the federal government released the detained BH members. So far, Parents have been able to identify about 77 of the abducted girls in the video.</div><div><br></div><div>Mr president was supposed to visit Chibok on the 16th of June but it was cancelled as a result of poor security clearance. The visit was publicized worldwide and therefore it had to be cancelled. Yes we expect more from the government but we surely don't want to lose the number 1 citizen in the mix. If he wants to visit, it should be a secret arrangement. Visit the troops, encourage them and leave quietly.</div><div><br></div><div>Jungle justice is starting to get comfortable in our society. In the month of May, there were a number of ugly cases. This reminds me of Aluu 4, people that were killed unjustly. Let's not take laws into our hands, allow the law to take it's course.</div><div><br></div><div>Hmmm... After 9 solid years of being at the emirates, arsenal finally lifted a trophy. They became FA cup champions on the 17th of May after dragging it with Hull city. It's been a very very very long wait. People actually shed tears that day. Over the years, players had come and gone, fans who had lost hope moved to other clubs. Arsenal had been at the receiving end of jokes over the years but after this victory, things changed for the better. Congrats to the true arsenal fans.</div><div><br></div><div>With the World Cup almost a month away, super eagles coach, Stephen Keshi has released the squad for the tournament in Brazil. While some prominent names like Ike Uche are missing, prodigal sons like Osaze Odemwingie have returned home. It is indeed a list of mixed feelings but overall we just want them to perform well and make us proud.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-bGVvsER7G_4/U4tuCicOqHI/AAAAAAAAA3o/YdtYaaUMIpk/s640/blogger-image--566968209.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-bGVvsER7G_4/U4tuCicOqHI/AAAAAAAAA3o/YdtYaaUMIpk/s640/blogger-image--566968209.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div>Tuesday may 20, witnessed double bombing situation in Jos. One went off by 3 pm and when people gathered to see what happened, another went off nearby at about 3:23 pm. Reprisal attacks started and a lot of people were injured, wounded and killed that day. The university of Jos lost 7 final year students and people that left their homes in the morning did not come back. These are not just numbers, they are human beings!</div><div><br></div><div>The most publicized and anticipated wedding of the year finally happened, Kim Kardashian got married to Kanye West this month. We finally saw pictures of Kelly Roland's marriage to Tim Witherspoon. She invited only 13 people to that wedding, cameras and phones weren't even allowed, still the pictures leaked. Sigh! The life of a superstar. Scandal's leading lady, Kerry Washington gave birth to her first daughter, Isabella. Yours truly is wishing them all the best in their new ventures.</div><div><br></div><div>The story of May didn't change much from that of April, it even seems to be getting worse. Let's learn to be security conscious even as we pray for a change. Don't spend too much time in public places like the mall, markets e.t.c. Be suspicious of any abnormality in your environment and always be alert. That the bombs have not started going off in your area doesn't mean it can never happen. Abuja and Jos used to be peaceful places until the day a bomb went off.</div><div><br></div><div>The sun will surely shine after the rain, but how for how long will it rain?</div><div><br></div><div>HAPPY NEW MONTH!!!</div>
