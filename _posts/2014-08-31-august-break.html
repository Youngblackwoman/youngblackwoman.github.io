<div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Dear diary,</span></div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-y7v90Fl-ghU/VAOApg0FWHI/AAAAAAAABGY/lbCF4Ua6eTc/s640/blogger-image--1137720409.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-y7v90Fl-ghU/VAOApg0FWHI/AAAAAAAABGY/lbCF4Ua6eTc/s640/blogger-image--1137720409.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div>Ever heard of the august break theory? Well I heard about it sometime back and I always look forward to August just so I can experience it. It's a period believed by many to be devoid of rain. The rains have been falling all year and august was looking like we were having a break, until the rain of August 29. Truly, that rain washed the earth clean. What major happenings/events took place during the August break? Find out as you read.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-iz0kWYJiITo/VAOAsjBG9jI/AAAAAAAABGg/scm6fB5vtbA/s640/blogger-image--120329735.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-iz0kWYJiITo/VAOAsjBG9jI/AAAAAAAABGg/scm6fB5vtbA/s640/blogger-image--120329735.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div>Ebola is still very much around. We thought we had contained it until a fresh case was discovered in porthacourt. Some infected people have recovered and have been discharged while others especially health workers have lost their lives to this deadly disease. Dr Adadevoh, the first doctor that came in contact with the Liberian victim, Patrick Sawyerr, also died. I pray that God comforts their family and give them peace. Don't forget to wash your hands frequently and avoid unnecessary contact with people. If you suspect anyone with the virus call the EBOLA HELPLINE: 0800-EBOLA-HELP.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qBlHiaqiIWw/VAOAnKooQ1I/AAAAAAAABGQ/PRJ2t6E2DXQ/s640/blogger-image-1391853339.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qBlHiaqiIWw/VAOAnKooQ1I/AAAAAAAABGQ/PRJ2t6E2DXQ/s640/blogger-image-1391853339.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div>Legendary actor, Robin Williams was found dead in his apartment in Tibourne, California. He was 63 years old. Autopsy result showed that he hanged himself with a belt. This is Ironic for someone who brought laughter and smiles to the faces of millions of people. His work as Peter Pan and the genie in Aladdin, will never be forgotten. Rest in peace, Robbin.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aAps31xEHi4/VANc7rqNPmI/AAAAAAAABFc/Qe20daGg78g/s640/blogger-image-307086318.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aAps31xEHi4/VANc7rqNPmI/AAAAAAAABFc/Qe20daGg78g/s640/blogger-image-307086318.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div>August was not a beautiful month for the medical doctors in Nigeria.
