Dear diary, how are you enjoying this harmattan season? I was still trying to be proud, not wanting to rub so much cream on my legs so they don't shine like that of *wax dummy* until i looked at my legs around noon yesterday. It's safe to say, my legs are all glossy and shiny today. As usual, yours truly has been observing her environment and thats the inspiration behind today's post. The letter N is for Nature.

According to the Merriam-Webster english dictionary; *Nature refers to the physical world and everything in it (such as plants, animals, mountains, oceans, stars, e.t.c.) that is not made by people.* It essentially talks about the natural forces that control what happens in the world. A lot of us don't have the time to *observe* nature. Where is the time to do so? is it in traffic to and from work? or is it within the four walls of an office surrounded by an array of fans and air conditioners? when do get to *enjoy the natural thing?.*

I remember when my phone battery went flat a couple of years ago, this was before the power banks we carry everywhere came into town. There was no way for me to charge the phone so I just left it on my bed and decided to sit outside pending when PHCN decides to restore power. I went out to the veranda and sat down watching people passing by. It was a beautiful moment for me because I was able to see and observe a lot of things. For the first time, I noticed the beautiful orchid growing in my neighbours backyard, it was really a magnificent sight to behold. I've seen him work on the land a couple of times through the window but I didn't have the slightest idea of what he was doing. Staying on the veranda that day also helped me to see a number of people that I didn't know were my neigbours. The breeze that evening was just perfect, it wasn't too cold or too hot. Watching the sun set and the moon came out that night just made me appreciate the beautiful work of our creator even more. PHCN restored power late in night but I was too pleased with mother nature to even get angry with them.

I want to implore you to take out time and just reflect, observe the environment that you live in. There's life outside twitter, snapchat and Instagram. You don't always have to take *bae* out to some fancy restaurant to impress her, you can just lay outside and look at the stars at night (*wink!*). If your environment is cluttered with houses and cars, you can take time out to go to a park, a ranch or even the beach, it's truly a beautiful experience. Put your phone down sometimes and just embrace mother nature in all her glory, afterall it's free of charge.

Take a walk, enjoy the cool breeze and clear your head. Nothing beats natural therapy. The earth has music for those who listen, are you listening?

We are learning...
