<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Dear diary,&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
I'm not going to tell you about fast and furious and how I cried at the end of #FF7. I'm just here to talk about F as a letter. I never knew that there were so many values that started with the letter F. Freedom, faith, food, finance, friendship, feminism amongst others are things that I hold very dear to my heart. So unlike the game I played with the letter C, I'm going to say a word or two about all of them. It's a win-win for us all.</div>

Freedom: freedom of speech, freedom to live, freedom to vote and be voted for, freedom to be yourself and all is a gift. Do you know what it feels like, not to be free? It's like being in prison. You can't do the things you want to do, you can't freely say what's on your mind, you can't live life like you would love to. You are stuck in a place and the only free thing within you is your mind. It freely roams around making you think about anything and everything. It's enough to drive you crazy! Let's be thankful that we have freedom and let us cherish it. Be wise in all your dealings and don't give anyone the power to take your freedom from you.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Faith: the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. How can you believe and hope for something you have no idea about? The people of old believed and were justified so ladies et gents, you just have to believe. Have faith that what you are looking for will come and believe me, God will show up for you.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Friendship: friends that become family. We all/some of us have that friend that we can always count on. People have friends to meet a particular need that they have. As long as that need is always met, the friendship blossoms. My question is, what happens when that need can longer be fulfilled? Will you still be friends? Look deeply at your friendship today and find the one reason to always remain friends no matter what. Some say if you never fight with your best friend then it's not real; how true is that? &nbsp;</div>

<br /></div>
<div>
Food: it's been used by many for different purposes; To satisfy hunger, to trap men, to make people jealous, to relieve stress, to kill people. Why really do you eat? Food is one of God's gift to man. Have you ever eaten a meal and lay back in your chair satisfied? That feeling cannot be bought, it can only be experienced. The good thing about food is that it can be cooked in different ways. The knowledge gained can never be lost, it can be refined in several ways to come out looking new. Some people say they can never eat some things but my theory about it is, never say never. Wait till you find someone to cook that meal properly for you and your mind, will be changed forever.&nbsp;</div>

Finance: this happens to be a very important aspect of our lives. If it's not managed well, it can cause a lot of trouble. Do you remember how you felt after you got your first pay? How excited you were and the plans you had for it? I'm tempted to ask you how you spent the money but never mind, you can reminisce secretly. Many of us are on a salary scale, we get paid every month and the bills keep coming too. It's an unending cycle; the more the salary, the more the bills. So how do we create a balance? We need to understand the difference between needs and wants. A need is something we must have in order to live while a want, let's just say you are craving for something. In order to live life, we have to satisfy our needs but to live a quality life, we have to sometimes go for what we want. &nbsp;We should have a scale of preference of what we want and in due time, we'll be able to satisfy our cravings. Don't be the kind of person that gets paid on Friday and by Saturday afternoon, you're <i>broke</i> again. That's recipe for disaster! Saving is very important especially if you are young. You have your whole life ahead of you and the best time to save, is now. Save a little even as you spend and with time, you'll master your finances.&nbsp;</div>

Feminism; a lot of people are jumping on the band wagon and are now card-carrying feminists. It is a range of ideologies that share a common goal; to define, establish, and achieve equal political, economic, cultural, personal and social rights for women. This includes seeking to establish equal opportunities for women in education and employment. It is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and interests. This is a very heated topic amongst my colleagues; giirls want equal rights with the guys but when it comes to doing the hard work, like carrying things and stuff, they like the guys to be in charge. We all need each other to survive, the sooner we understand &nbsp;that, the better for us all.</div>

*phew! This was a pretty long post. I hope you enjoyed reading as I did, writing. I decided to talk about all these values because I believe they all appeal to each and everyone of us. I would like to know your opinion on some of them though, values like friendship, finances and feminism can never truly be exhausted.</div>
