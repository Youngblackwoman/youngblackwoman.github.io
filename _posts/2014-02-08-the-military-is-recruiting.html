<div>Dear diary,</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aQjZ-70L_WM/UvaSQXZTEJI/AAAAAAAAAsA/QbxLvp5T0Zc/s640/blogger-image-706760351.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aQjZ-70L_WM/UvaSQXZTEJI/AAAAAAAAAsA/QbxLvp5T0Zc/s640/blogger-image-706760351.jpg"></a></div></div><div><br></div><div>Have you heard? The military is recruiting!!!</div><div><br></div><div>The military consists of the navy, army, Air Force et others. They go to war and try to defend their territory. They know they may die in the process but still, they are willing to fight. They leave loved ones and families at home to go to different parts of the world to fight. &nbsp;Yours truly has always dreamt of one of them as the rib finder seeing how brave et courageous they are. Now, she's no longer sure. Hypertension is not that easy to manage and having le boo out there exposed to any and all sorts is sure to raise the pressure.</div><div><br></div><div>I never really took time to know so much about them in the past but now I'm glad i did it because it has helped me to appreciate them more. There's a lot to learn from them.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Their courage: even after being wounded and shot so many times, they still fight. They never go down easily, it's a fight to finish. That is pretty much different from they way we live here. The moment we see a little problem rear it's ugly head, we retreat and cry. We feel God is punishing us for our sins forgetting that nothing can ever separate us from his love. We should learn to face our challenges and problems squarely. If we run away from them, they'll come back to hunt us someday. Deal with today's problems, today.</div><div><br></div><div>Their unity: no matter what they go through, they stick together. They are not born of the same parents but when they are on that mountain, air or sea, they become brothers. Even when one of their men is down or wounded, they don't leave him behind. They carry him along and still fight back. In our own little world, we are not even at war with anybody and yet we are not unified. We fight with ourselves at any given chance when we should overlook the wrongs and tolerate each other. Giving our poor hearts aches and troubles when should be at peace with ourselves.</div><div><br></div><div>Their service: yes, they are getting paid shouldn't they serve well? But we forget that money is not everything. They remain dedicated to their call of duty which is to serve and protect. Some of us think service is about house boys and house girls but it's far from that. We can serve by helping that old woman or those little kids to cross the road. As little as sweeping your compound on a Saturday morning instead of waiting for neighbors to do so when you know they will end up not doing it, is a form of service. It's not always about how much or how far but how well. It's the little things that matter.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>They are not all perfect as it's with other aspects of life, there are bad eggs amongst them. Try to emulate the good ones and you'll learn a lot.</div><div><br></div><div>Then again must we even have wars in this world of ours?! That's a story for another day.</div><div><br></div><div>I pray for Gods protection upon them wherever they are, may they return safely to their friends and family. Also remember that no matter the challenges you face in life, Never under fight!!!</div><div><br></div><div>P.S: how many of you will like to join the army? ;)</div><div><br></div>
