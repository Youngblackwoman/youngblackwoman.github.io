<div>Dear Diary,</div><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZH-kue8Vb-c/VFFJZbD7BJI/AAAAAAAABNQ/Q1_zFCnUQV4/s1600/pink%2Boctober.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZH-kue8Vb-c/VFFJZbD7BJI/AAAAAAAABNQ/Q1_zFCnUQV4/s1600/pink%2Boctober.jpg" /></a></div><br /></div><div>The 10th month of the year 2014 is gradually coming to an end. A lot went underwater this month and it affected different people in different ways. It was also Breast cancer awareness month all over the world. What do you know about breast cancer? Do you know how to examine yourself? Have you examined yourself lately? Early detection is the key to surviving breast cancer, examine yourself today. Let's look back at all the events that made October pink.</div><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oUa_7ezYKyQ/VFFMNHfG-iI/AAAAAAAABOA/-WT54oSi4XU/s1600/TwImg-20141001-075548.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oUa_7ezYKyQ/VFFMNHfG-iI/AAAAAAAABOA/-WT54oSi4XU/s1600/TwImg-20141001-075548.jpg" height="170" width="400" /></a></div><br /></div><div>October 1st! Nigeria celebrated her 54th Independence anniversary as a nation this month. Where we are now as a country is a far cry from where we ought to be but not to worry, we'll get there someday. To &nbsp;commemorate this day, one of Nollywoods finest (i do mean that literally) Kunle Afolayan, released his new movie titled October 1st. This movie has raised the bar of movie production in Nigeria and no matter how much I hype it, it won't do it justice. If you haven't seen it, please do so.</div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LOCjnqs7sSk/VFFKjUWX5DI/AAAAAAAABNo/luZLdKNSdUk/s1600/ODLR.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><br /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rAKXKgyDnHQ/VFFJ25LJsFI/AAAAAAAABNY/MFjhYMoZKTA/s1600/Ebola%2Bdoctors.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rAKXKgyDnHQ/VFFJ25LJsFI/AAAAAAAABNY/MFjhYMoZKTA/s1600/Ebola%2Bdoctors.jpg" height="213" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /></div><div>Nigeria was declared Ebola-free this month by the World Health Organization (W.H.O). One of the few stories in the news that has put a smile on the faces of Nigerians in recent times. We really appreciate the efforts of those that helped in the fight against this disease. Ebola viral disease has been recorded in 8 countries so far; Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Senegal, United States of America, Mali and Spain. Over 4000 people have died from this disease and 8.997 cases have been recorded so far. This too shall pass. To all the bereaved families, those that have been affected in one way or the other, I pray that you'll be comforted.</div><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sXlljjL1p3s/VFFKOt5ZBGI/AAAAAAAABNg/dLFJMXO-WN0/s1600/IMG_2992.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sXlljjL1p3s/VFFKOt5ZBGI/AAAAAAAABNg/dLFJMXO-WN0/s1600/IMG_2992.JPG" height="213" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /></div><div>The #Almostabride series is still running on this blog.

The champions defeated Cameroon 2-0 in the final match of the competition to cling their 7th AWC title.

The keeper of the South African national football team who never conceded a goal for the national team, was shot dead at his home near Johannesburg by a 7-man gang of robbers. May the souls of the faithful departed rest in peace.</div><div><br /></div><div>The bomb blasts returned this month &nbsp;in the north and our peace as a nation is being threatened once again. Men and women are being kidnapped daily and insecurity is on the rise. The 2015 general elections are almost here and campaigns are in full gear. As a citizen, it is your right to vote and be voted for. Please register on time so you can vote and make a change. Refuse to be cajoled against your will, the temporary gifts you receive now in secret may cause a permanent scar. A lot of mistakes have been made in the past and the time to correct them is now. Our girls are still missing and so is the Malaysian plane (#MH370)</div><div><br /></div><div>Did you celebrate your birthday this month?
