She had to enjoy the weekend because she had a busy Monday ahead. She got back home on Sunday evening and did her best to get prepared for Monday, by ironing her cloths, arranging her books et all. She had to leave the house very early in the morning. She told her mum to wake her up on time and even set an alarm for 5.30 am. She went to bed with a mindset of waking up early (uh…hmm). To cut the story short she woke up by 9:15 in the morning&nbsp;(hahaha)<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">SITUATION 2;<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Richard, a university undergraduate had just had a fun weekend and even forgot that he had a test in school on Tuesday. He got back to school on Monday and saw his mates reading. The library was packed with people and <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>even the class was full. Then it hit him…he had not looked at his books. He ran to the hostel, picked his books and ran to the class. On his way to class, he kept murmuring to himself “I will not sleep this night, ehn when I’ve not read anything…I must do overnight!” He read till the early hours of the morning and only went to the hostel to have his bath and take his identity card. He entered the exam all and all he could write on his answer sheet was his name and matriculation number. Needless to say what he scored in the test.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><br /></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">We have all had this kind of experience at one time or the other in our lives. As funny as It sounds, not a few of us have been in such quagmire. We like to relax, rest and sleep. Sleeping isn’t a bad thing, its something that is a norm in our lives. As good and refreshing as it is, when it is taken to the extreme it becomes a problem. A lot of times we really want to wake up early et all but sleep just draws us back. Sometimes we even set alarms but by morning when the alarm is ringing we wake up, put it off and go back to sleep….funny isn’t it, like they say the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Back in high school, my mates and I <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>were preparing for our final exams and so each time we were feeling sleepy we would tell our friends to wake us up in 15 minutes that even if we don’t want <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>to answer them, they should pour us water and beat us (all these were done, just so we could read..lol). I remember one time, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the 15 minutes was over and it was time to wake them up. The so-called ‘friend’ would try to wake her friend to read but she would not wake-up and so she poured the water on her and that’s when the fight started. The friend screamed and cursed her friend for trying to disturb her sleep…hahaha, I couldn’t hide my laughter. Some of us just sleep not because we want to but because we can’t control it which may really be a sign of laziness. Some even sugar coat it by saying ‘I’m not sleeping I just like staring at my eyelids when they are covered’…YEAH RIGHT!<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In the same manner not having enough sleep can be pretty depressing. You can hardly focus on anything when you are in a state like that. It’s just a case of jack of all trades but master of none. In this age people brag about insomnia like it’s a good thing…..do you know that research has proven that insomnia serves as the basis of certain diseases that affect us in this present age??? Well now you know. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>An adult is supposed to have between 6-8 hrs of sleep but these days with traffic and other activities people sleep by 12 and wake up by 3 just so they can make it early to their place of work. I can imagine how stressful that is.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If you are like Christine and you like to sleep a lot, well maybe you should try to discipline yourself and learn to beat sleep at its own game. Try to understand yourself and regulate your sleeping pattern. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>If symptoms persist beyond your ability, see a doctor. It might just be that your body is trying to tell you something. Like a part in proverbs that says ‘take a cue from the ants, as small as they are they work so hard just so they can earn their daily bread’. While you are sleeping, people are working.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If you are a Richard in the making, It’s of no use really to work so hard and end up in the grave before your time is due neither is it fulfilling to achieve nothing with the time you have on earth. Try to get enough sleep so that your body can rest. Imagine your body was a machine and it does so much work without being serviced once in a while, it would just pack up one day. There should be a balance because health is wealth.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Dear Reader, I hope I have been able to convince you and not confuse you on both the good side and bad side of sleep. Examine yourself today!<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">GRACIAS!<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">P.S: part of the inspiration for this post came from a friend of mine…..lol. xoxo<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>
