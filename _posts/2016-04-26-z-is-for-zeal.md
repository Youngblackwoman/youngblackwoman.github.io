Dear diary, it's the last letter of the alphabet! It's been a long time coming and I'm happy to finally be here. I have learnt a lot during this series and I hope you have too. We are looking at the letter Z today and it stands for Zeal. Passion, commitment and enthusiasm are some of the words people use to describe zeal. It's an important value that should be shared to aid personal development.

Zeal is that great energy or enthusiasm in pursuit o a cause or an objective. It is that strong feeling that makes you determined to do something. I see it as that drive that sustains us in the pursuit of a particular goal. Without zeal, a lot of our plans and ideas would remain words on paper. Following a well drafted plan, zeal is required to put that plan into action.

*"Through zeal knowledge is gotten, through lack of zeal, knowledge is lost; let a man who knows this double path of gain and loss thus place himself that he may grow."* **-Buddha**

Zeal is important because the road to success in anything in life is usually paved with up's and down's. When those obstacles show up at your door step, what are you going to do about them? That's were your driving force (zeal) comes into place. Discover what your driving force is and strengthen it with each set back in life, so that you are more than ready for whatever comes your way.

Some have a blind zeal i.e go in the direction of a different thing other than what was the original plan. You must constantly remind yourself of what is your reason for wanting to succeed at something, that way you ensure you are in line with the objective. A wise man once said that zeal without knowledge is like fire without light. The two of them go hand in hand, one cannot be complete without the other. Get knowledge, grow your passion/ zeal for a particular goal and watch as you achieve greatness.

*"Experience shows that success is due less to ability than to zeal"* **Charles Buxton**

We are learning...

**P.S: Please watch out for the next post which has all the letters of the series in it. You can always go back and read any letter you are not quite sure about.**
