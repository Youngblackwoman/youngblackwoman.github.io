Dear diary, how are you doing today? The Monday hustle doesn't get any easier now does it? It's something we should be used to by now and rather than *screaming internally* as it approaches, I think we should prepare ourselves for it. Today's post is a very patriotic one and I hope it does the needful i.e stimulate us to be unified more than ever.

A lot of things are happening are going wrong in our environment today; from the tinniest unit in society- the family, to the society at large, a lot of things are just not right. We can attribute a lot of reasons to it but one major factor is the lack of unity. It's not like we totally hate each other but we just choose not to agree with one another for reasons best known to us. It's gotten so bad that agreeing with another person's opinion is seen as abnormal while disagreeing with each other is the norm.

Unity may be defined as a condition of harmony; the quality or state of being one, the state of those who are in full agreement. It is a totality of related parts, an entity that is a complex or systematic whole.
