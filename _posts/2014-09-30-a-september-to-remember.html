<div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Dear diary,&nbsp;</span></div><div><br /></div><div>The 'ember months are here!!! It's the season of months that end with 'ember (except for October of course). A lot of superstitions, stories and myths trail these months but like the good book says, be it unto you according to your faith. With the number of things that happened this month; the good, the bad and the ugly, September is definitely a month to remember. Do sit back on your couch, cross your legs on the table and grab your popcorn as we reminisce the month of September.</div><div><br /></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eWmOx174Mx8/VCsgZlQdLvI/AAAAAAAABIs/6RqBwYergfE/s640/blogger-image--1901918757.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eWmOx174Mx8/VCsgZlQdLvI/AAAAAAAABIs/6RqBwYergfE/s640/blogger-image--1901918757.jpg" /></a></div><br /></div><div>THE GOOD:</div><div>The award winning series: ALMOST A BRIDE, started on the first day of September. You know that feeling mothers get when they see their new born child, that's how we felt when we pushed the first Episode out.</div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-n2ZZ0kxAZhs/VCsg0aBIKSI/AAAAAAAABJE/G76sx5illlo/s640/blogger-image--989043579.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-n2ZZ0kxAZhs/VCsg0aBIKSI/AAAAAAAABJE/G76sx5illlo/s640/blogger-image--989043579.jpg" /></a></div></div><div>A lot of reactions have followed it and I'm loving the feedback. A new episode is released every Monday at exactly 12:00 pm, if you haven't been following join the series now:&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/1taUzcW" target="_blank">Almost a bride.</a></div><div><br /></div><div>Ebola has been contained in Nigeria. This has to be the best news in recent times for Nigerians. We've faced so much damage this year, that the Ebola scare was just too much for us to handle. All those that were in quarantine have been released and there has been no new case. We lost some people in the fight to contain it but we are also thankful for the ones that survived it. May God comfort the bereaved families and keep us from such occurrence again.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Tinsel actor Chris attoh and fianc√©e, Damilola Adegbite welcomed their son this month. TV/Movie producer Tyler Perry a.k.a Madea, is expecting a baby with his Ethiopian model girlfriend Gelila Bekele. Inasmuch as this has been given a lot of his fans (imaginary girlfriends) sleepless nights, we are very happy for him. Nigerian musician Flavour and his girlfriend, Sandra Okagbue have welcomed their first child together. Former US president, Bill Clinton and wife Hilary, welcomed their first grandchild this month. What a <i>babyful</i> month!</div><div><br /></div><div>Hollywood actor, George Clooney, married his British lawyer girlfriend Amal Alamuddin in a 4 day wedding ceremony.</div><div><br /></div><div>We finally have a winner for the MTN project fame show season 7. Geoffrey Oji emerged winner of this season out of thousands that came for the audition. Congratulations Geoffrey!</div><div><br /></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EmJm6Y7CTBE/VCsgxmhTCnI/AAAAAAAABI8/USbgJoVx2RU/s640/blogger-image--606498450.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EmJm6Y7CTBE/VCsgxmhTCnI/AAAAAAAABI8/USbgJoVx2RU/s640/blogger-image--606498450.jpg" /></a></div><br /></div><div>Apple released the iPhone 6 and 6plus this month after much waiting. It is the eight generation of the iPhone to be released. What are you waiting for? Go get yours now!</div><div><br /></div><div>THE BAD:</div><div><br /></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aJV3HxgwRsQ/VCsgdKsmLtI/AAAAAAAABI0/80YWa4bUURA/s640/blogger-image-2142967935.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aJV3HxgwRsQ/VCsgdKsmLtI/AAAAAAAABI0/80YWa4bUURA/s640/blogger-image-2142967935.jpg" /></a></div></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br /></div><div>American model, Amber Rose has filed for a divorce from her musician husband, Wiz Khalifa. According to her, Wiz cheated on her. Also, Jason Derulo and longtime girlfriend, Jordin sparks have called it quits. Jason said he felt "pressured to marry" and so he opted out.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>THE UGLY:</div><div>FashionPolice crooner Joan Rivers died at age 81 after she suffered cardiac arrest during a surgical procedure. She looked so full of life that no one expected it. While she means a lot of things to different people, she'll always be remembered as the lady that left an indelible mark on the fashion police show and the world at large.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Vice chairman of Sun Newspapers in Nigeria, Dimgba Igwe was killed while jogging on a Saturday morning. He was knocked down by a vehicle. It was really sad hearing about this because I grew up reading his articles. He died at the age of 58. May he gentle soul rest in peace.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Synagogue church of all nations building in Lagos, Nigeria, collapsed sometime this month killing about 115 people. Controversies have continued to trail the issue and a lot of accusing fingers are being pointed. People are playing the blame game forgetting that people, human beings not just numbers lost their lives in the collapse.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>THE INDIFFERENT</div><div>South African athlete, Oscar Pistorius has been cleared of both premeditated and second degree murder of his girlfriend Reeva SteenKamp. A lot of mixed feelings from different corners of the world.</div><div><br /></div><div>American Musician Ciara, returned &nbsp;her 15-carat emerald engagement ring to her baby daddy. She had a baby for him but she was cheated on so the union was dissolved. Again yours truly is indifferent about this. Meanwhile, would you return your engagement ring if you and your partner break up?</div><div><br /></div><div>The 2015 general elections are almost here. Our celebrities have started showing their interest and have started vying for different positions. The likes of Tony Tetuila, Desmond Elliot, 9ice have all indicated their interest to vie for certain positions.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Chibok girls are still missing even though we heard rumors of their release. It's been over 4 months since their abduction. The MH370 plane and it's passengers are still missing.</div><div><br /></div><div>To all those that celebrated birthdays, got married, gave birth to babies, got promoted at the office, graduated from school or even did something spectacular this month, I celebrate with you. October can only be better, I wish you all the best in the coming month.</div><div><br /></div><div>HAPPY NEW MONTH!</div><div><br /></div>
