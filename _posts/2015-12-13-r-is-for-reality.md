Dear diary, how did you fare with the [questions](http://thediaryoayoungblackwoman.com/2015/12/12/Q-is-for-questions.md) asked on the blog yesterday? have you examined yourself thoroughly? well if you have, it's time to wake up to reality. Yes, R is for Reality.

In many aspects of our lives, we are constantly reminded to face reality. In school, at work place, in relationships and even on the sick bed. What is this reality that everyone keeps talking about? Reality is the true situation that exists: the real situation. According to the Merriam-Webster English dictionary, reality is something that actually exists or happens. A lot of people like to fantasize a lot, we like to think about the *what if's* and *maybe's*, which is a good idea. The other part to this is that while you are lying down, crossing your legs on the couch and *thinking*, some people are actually working hard to achieve their own dreams. You have dreamt and thought about it, when are you going to start *doing* it? Reality has always been there, it doesn't just pop out of nowhere. We just choose to give it a blind eye until we are ready to face it.

*"Reality does not conform to the ideal, but confirms it".* **-Gustav Flaubert**

People are often in denial when something bad happens to them; when they loose their phone, when they fail at something, the loss of a loved one e.t.c. This attitude is very common in relationships that have fallen apart. It's not easy waking up to a life without the one you thought would always be there but you have to wake up and smell the coffee. We tend to believe that denial makes it easier to go past the trouble at the time but we all know it isn't true. It's only a matter of time before reality stares you in the face and you see all the time you have wasted, living in denial. I believe when you are hurt, you should cry about it; be human, scream, shout, express yourself in whatever way you choose to (don't break stuff though, that's gangstar), it's better to let it all out then so you don't wake up one morning and start crying for no reason. When you are done, wipe your tears and face the reality of things. Learn from the mistakes made and move on, knowing that you are wiser than you were before.

*"Either you deal with what is the reality, or you can be sure that the reality is going to deal with you."* **-Alex Haley**

How do you know it's time to wake up to reality? when you have explored every aspect of the problem and there's no way out. Someone once said the first step to madness, is trying to make sense of everything; somethings should just be left alone. There's no wisdom in fighting till you are dead, instead there's wisdom in knowing when to come out of the ring, re-strategizing and going back stronger.

Have you failed at something recently? have you cried/wailed/thought about it? if you have, then it's time to get back into action. There's no time to apportion blames to others for your failure, get back into the game and face the reality that has been waiting for you to wake up.

Do a reality check today on different aspects of your life, identify the areas where you are sleeping and wake up.  

*"Face reality as it is, not as it was or as you wish it to be".* **-Jack Welch**
