**Ene is married**

She did not have to draw her brows, looking permanently surprised every morning.

She did not have to carry a plot of land on her head in the name of human hair.

She did not highlight her brows nor contour her cheeks.

She did not have to put on a dark red lipstick to remind everyone of Snow White's fairy tale.

But Ene is married, she's married to a fine man.


**Ene is married**

She is not as tall as a model neither does she possess the body of a goddess.

She doesn't dress to kill; as long as she is comfortable in it, she'll wear it.

She rarely wears stiletto heels, she doesn't see the fun in standing on a pair of toothpicks.

She wears her hair anyhow she pleases, the natural hair nazis have nothing on her.

But Ene is married, she's married to a fine military man.

**Ene is married**

She is quiet but she never fails to voice out an opinion when disturbed.

She enjoys her own company and is comfortable with herself.

She has a few good friends and when they want to hangout, it's fun non-stop.

She never tries to impress anyone, she is unashamedly herself.

But Ene is married, she's married to a fine military man that works as a doctor.


**Ene is married**

Dr Aliu married Ene yesterday in the presence of close friends and family.

She glowed as she walked down the aisle, her beauty radiated like the morning sun.

The tall, dark and handsome hunk put a ring on her finger and a lid on the mouth of gossips.

He has given Ene his last name and the tale-bearers, one more bout of shame.

But Ene is married, she's married to the Love of her life.


This is just one of the random musings of yours truly. I have absolutely no problems with any of the issues raised above but Ene married the man of many ladies dream without breaking a sweat. It may have taken Ene years of singlehood and patience before meeting Dr Aliu but it was worth the wait. Ene is that shy, timid girl that thinks she's not good enough for anyone. She's that lonely girl that doesn't understand why no one wants to go into a relationship with her. Ene is that girl that would not compromise on her values just to suit the desires of a man of the moment. Ene is me, Ene is you.
