Dear diary,<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_XA-9J2vSf0/UxxthQ7K9LI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/JosrRyFB7Bk/s640/blogger-image--1128825766.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_XA-9J2vSf0/UxxthQ7K9LI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/JosrRyFB7Bk/s640/blogger-image--1128825766.jpg"></a></div><br>You must have heard of them, you must have attended them. Motivational motivations abound in the land. You must have seen the &nbsp;posters of these seminars where people where invited to speak and 'speak' they did. Titles of these seminars vary and may include; 10 steps to success; Being the perfect leader; Wife &nbsp;material 101, A dreamer today, a doer tomorrow; From FATima to THINa, the list is endless!<br><br>We all listen, nod our heads, say the hmmms and ahhhhs, we start planning and dreaming of our next big step but the moment we leave that place, the whole thing flies out of our heads. What transpires between the seminar and the outside world, that is powerful enough to kill the once motivated spirit? Occasionally the thought arises out of the blues in your head but you quickly shove it aside because you think it's impossible.<br><br>I also enjoy attending these seminars but what puzzles me is the way we human beings refuse to change even after we have literally been flogged with more than enough word to motivate us. Some of us are so stagnant that it would take a crane to move us. The speakers at these seminars often give rhymes while teaching such that you wonder if they are rappers on the side. Words like you have to perspire to aspire so you can inspire....<br><br>And the crowd screams in excitement.<br><br>For some people, it's almost a way of life. You attend motivational seminars every week and nobody is seeing any change. Some even play the audio messages everyday, still nothing. What are you then learning? Weight loss, success and the likes most times require motivation and if there's no motivation, it may not come to fruition.<br><br>You have heard the message, you have taken down the notes, now it's time to put them into action. Since you have taken the pain (or transport money, as the case may be) to attend these programs you may as well do yourself the favor of trying them out. Fear is one of the greatest obstacles following motivation. Will it work? Can I do it? How will I do it? Is it possible? These questions will never be answered if you don't act.<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Aqcwq7flv5M/UxxtuE_8YmI/AAAAAAAAAtY/4cfaysnFlKQ/s640/blogger-image--447855227.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Aqcwq7flv5M/UxxtuE_8YmI/AAAAAAAAAtY/4cfaysnFlKQ/s640/blogger-image--447855227.jpg"></a></div><br>This post is another motivational motivation. Yes, I am motivating you to be motivated. I hope you have been motivated to move because the best form of motivation is self-motivation.<br><br>If you don't motivate yourself, no one will!
