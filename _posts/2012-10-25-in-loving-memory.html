It seemed like it had been in the room for some time because the manner in which it ran from bunk to bunk showed that it was no "jjc". We were at a loss, because we didn't know what to do with it.  Its not like we were scared or anything of the sort because we had tried chasing it out before but yours truly almost broke an arm. No one was ready to be tied up in P.O.P (plaster of paris) so, we decided to let sleeping dogs lie.<br /><br />We waited earnestly and prayed fervently that it would one day,  leave the room. Day by day we hoped that it would find the door open and scramble away. ...But this did not happen. One day, our prayers were answered. The student body had placed a circular on the notice board stating that the hostels would be fumigated within the next week. Our joy knew no bounds as we waited in excitement.<br /><br /><br />They came fully clothed in their attire looking like the ghost busters one  morning, and they were ready to carry out their business. They sprayed different chemicals in the room and even placed certain tablets on the floor. All we needed now was time so we could see the effect.<br /><br />I was rushing to class one morning and was about to pull out my shoe and Voila!.....there it was all cuddled up in the shoe lying cold in death. It must have eaten one of the tablets  placed by the fumigating team. It looks like it crawled and crawled with pain after it had eaten the "forbidden fruit", looking for its final resting place. Then it saw it, that beautiful shoe (more like a casket) where It would lay and say its final prayers. It curled itself into a comfortable position and drifted into eternal rest.<br /><br />THE END ;'(<br /><br /><br />To its fellow creatures, I say weep not!.......for it is only a matter of time before you all join your fellow compatriot. Enjoy the life that you have now because it may be taken from you in the twinkling of an eye.<br /><br /><br />R.I.P --------&gt; Rattus Rattus<br />.......Your "athletic skills" will be missed and your memory will remain indelible in THEIR hearts. ADIOS :'(<br /><br /><br /><br />GRACIAS
