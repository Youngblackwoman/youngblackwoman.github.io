Dear diary, how are you doing today? Were you able to achieve all that you planned to in the last week? Not to worry, today's post will help you to make better plans for the coming week. We would be looking at Wisdom today and how it impacts our lives. You may have heard some of the things I'll be sharing with you before but there's no harm in having a gentle reminder. What's so fascinating about Wisdom and why is everyone going in search of her? I hope this post helps to provide answers to your questions.

I have a friend who is quite knowledgeable about a lot of things (a lot). When he talks, people listen. Now he isn't saying anything new or out of the blues, he is just gifted with being able to apply the knowledge he has gained over time. People who come in contact with him always leave with a smile on their faces, like he said something magical to them. That is the whole essence of wisdom; to share it with others. If knowledge gained isn't shared with others then there's no wisdom in it.

Wisdom is the application of knowledge. It is the quality of having experience, knowledge and good judgement. Merriam-Webster describes it as the knowledge that is gained by having many experiences in life. That is one definition that truly covers the concept of wisdom. A wise person is one who has a desire to understand things from different perspectives instead of a straight forward way of thinking. There are a number of factors that may influence gaining wisdom in individuals and they include; cultural variation, individual ideologies, age and so much more.

*"For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding."* **-Proverbs 2:6**

Wisdom may be gotten through different means such as life experiences over time, listening to advise from others, gaining knowledge from reading widely and best of all, from our father in heaven. People who get wisdom from life experiences usually like to share this wisdom with others. These experiences may be good or bad but they leave us with lessons that'll guide us through this maze-tunnel called life. People who get wisdom from the advise of others are very rare, and that is because only a few people in this life are not too proud to take advise from a human being like them. Also, people who get wisdom from reading widely are not that common in this part of the world (I'm sure you know why this is so). The wisdom gotten from our father in heaven is the best gift you can get especially in this day and time, it's importance cannot be overestimated.  

How do you recognize a wise person? A wise person is disciplined, learns from mistakes made, patient, knows his/her priorities, takes calculated risks and is strong enough (mentally, physically, emotionally) to handle any situation. If you see anyone around you with such qualities, it doesn't hurt to interact with them and get wisdom. We must learn to go in search of wisdom because her value is priceless. You cannot buy wisdom, it's either you have it or you don't. Don't fall into the category of people who always say, *"Had i known..."* whenever something goes wrong because sometimes, these things can actually be avoided. Meet people, gain wisdom from their wealth of experience, read widely and also pray for wisdom for it is the most important thing. Someone once said, he enjoyed the company of old people and I never saw reason for that until I became aware of the concept of wisdom. We can learn from anyone around us, we must not be too proud to do so.

Wisdom is profitable to direct, even the good book says so. The application of knowledge gained helps to provide a sense of well-being, building strong relationships. Having wisdom helps you to overcome obstacles that would seem pretty difficult for those that lack it. We need wisdom for practically everything in life; to plan better, to see life in a whole new dimension. Wisdom when applied helps to prevent costly mistakes and aids wise decision making.  You were not placed on earth to occupy space, please go in search of wisdom and when you find her, do not hesitate to share with others.

*"Wisdom is the principal thing..."* **-Proverbs 4:7**

We are learning...
