<br><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Dear Diary,</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-b91Mc46MUuA/Urg-OqPLRfI/AAAAAAAAApQ/2z3MqevQCkQ/s640/blogger-image-1814524082.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-b91Mc46MUuA/Urg-OqPLRfI/AAAAAAAAApQ/2z3MqevQCkQ/s640/blogger-image-1814524082.jpg"></a></div></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></div><span lang="EN-US">It’s that time of the year again. Love is in the air. People are exchanging gifts, travelling and generally in a joyful mood. I want to crave your indulgence to read this story as you tear that piece of meat with your canine. ENJOY!</span><br><br><div class="MsoNormal"><br></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The birth of the royal baby took place under these circumstances:</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">His mother Maria engaged to Josephat, before they came together, was found to be pregnant through the power of a spirit. Her fiancée Josephat, being a gentleman, did not want to disgrace her so he decided to dump her quietly. As he was thinking this over, a spirit visited him in his dream,</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Josephat! David pikin! Wetin you dey think so?! No fear to marry Maria with her belle o. the pikin wey she go born go get power wella. Na bonboy she go born and you go call am Emma, which mean say baba God dey for our side. Na him go save all dose people wey don dey do bad bad thing all these years. No fear o!”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Josephat woke up from his sleep and did as the spirit said. He took Maria as his wife. He had no sexual relation with her until she gave birth to the baby.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">There were some astrologers in the land on a journey from the east and an angel appeared to them saying;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“no fear o! na beta gist I dey bring una today. e get one baby wey dem go born today, na him go save the whole world. Na expo I dey give una so. Make una go find am, dem wrap the baby for wrapper, e dey inside one small hut.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now the baby was born in the days of Otunba,the notorious and power drunk king of Jerusha. The astrologers from the east came to Jerusha and inquired;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“where the king wey dem born? We done see him star dey shine tey tey and we don come hail am o, na so we find am come, wey am?”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When Otunba heard this, he was disturbed. A child that would dethrone him? Impossible! He called a meeting of the magicians and wizards in the land and asked them where the baby would be born and they replied;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">“dem go born am for boko in Jerusha. Na so dem pastor talk.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Otunba then sent for the astrologers and asked them questions about the child. Then he sent them to Boko saying;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“ make una go find dat pikin! find am!. Wen una find am, make una halla me, make I come hail am too.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The astrologers continued their journey. They followed the star until it stood over the place where the child was. Excited, they went into the house and saw the baby with his mother Maria. They fell on their knees and worshipped the baby. Then they opened their bags and gave him gifts of gold, myrhh and frankincense. An angel warned them in their dream not to go back to Otunba but to return to their country using <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>a different route.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When they had gone, an angel appeared unto Josephat telling him to carry Maria and the baby to Egolo, a faraway village and hide them because Otunba wanted to kill the baby. When Otunba realized that he had been deceived by the astrologers, he directed that all the male children in Boko be killed, hoping that junior will be killed too. Years later, Otunba died and Josephat took his family to a small town called Nazir and there he raised junior in the way of the Lord.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">THE END.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The birth of Jesus Christ brought peace and salvation into the world. As we celebrate his birth this season, lets remember to show love to those around us. Family, friends, neighbors, orphans, widows and the less privileged around us all deserve love. Expression of this love unites us in him.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"></span></div>
