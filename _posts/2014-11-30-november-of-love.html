<div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Dear Diary,</span></div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-iwHyZ1qTnwA/VHshycMs-NI/AAAAAAAABVU/Gvm0fzx-wRU/s640/blogger-image--219590885.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-iwHyZ1qTnwA/VHshycMs-NI/AAAAAAAABVU/Gvm0fzx-wRU/s640/blogger-image--219590885.jpg"></a></div></div><div><br></div><div>The November train has reached it's last stop. It's been a month of love so far even though a number of sad occurrences tried to becloud our judgement. A lot of birthdays were celebrated this month and it isn't a coincidence considering that the month of November is exactly 9 months away from February. Let's see what rocked and sucked this November.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Ord9smvsKNg/VHsi-HXW2sI/AAAAAAAABVk/lebWnZljsjk/s640/blogger-image-1907624396.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Ord9smvsKNg/VHsi-HXW2sI/AAAAAAAABVk/lebWnZljsjk/s640/blogger-image-1907624396.jpg"></a></div></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div>November 1st was a beautiful Saturday this year. A number of weddings took place that day and &nbsp;there couldn't have been a better way to start the month. #SLAM2014, Lamide Lagos' marriage to his boo paved the way for weddings this month and it wouldn't be forgotten in a long while. Nollywood actor, Okechukwu Ukeje also got married this month to his fianc√©e Ibukun Togonu-Bickersteth. They serenaded the guests with beautiful dance moves and you could literally see the love in their eyes. Let's not forget the all white wedding that dazzled us; the wedding ceremony between Solange Knowles and Alan Ferguson. Yours truly is wishing the newly wedded November couples peace, love and beautiful babies.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-aDhirJytoRQ/VHsXzK2FclI/AAAAAAAABUg/fSUCyDmj_w4/s640/blogger-image-726143572.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-aDhirJytoRQ/VHsXzK2FclI/AAAAAAAABUg/fSUCyDmj_w4/s640/blogger-image-726143572.jpg"></a></div></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div>Your favorite series, Almost a bride came to an end this month. Ihuoma finally found brother Shola and they are even expecting a baby. The faces behind the scenes of the project were revealed and the reviews have been beautiful. Incase you missed it, read it here.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-m2GeEWlf5Ys/VHsgBfOv_wI/AAAAAAAABU8/JW6bSKz2bNk/s640/blogger-image--1211105437.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-m2GeEWlf5Ys/VHsgBfOv_wI/AAAAAAAABU8/JW6bSKz2bNk/s640/blogger-image--1211105437.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div>Former Destiny child crooner Kelly Rowland, gave birth to her son Titan Jewel Witherspoon, this month. Also, nigerian comedienne Helen Paul, gave birth to her second child. Alicia keys and music producer husband, Swizz beats are expecting a child. One of my favorite couples of the year, Dr and Mrs Sidney Esiri are also expecting. Congratulations y'all. Meanwhile, a video went viral this month about a baby, Aneela being maltreated by her nanny in Uganda. A very traumatizing video that'll make you question the fact that we all were created by the same person. The baby is still alive, thankfully but the nanny is being prosecuted at the moment. As parents, let's be vigilant about our children and all that concerns them. Nobody can truly love them like we do.</div><div><br></div><div>The Super Eagles of Nigeria have lost the chance to qualify for the AFCON 2015 games. The defending champions failed to emerge from the qualifying round and as such, they won't have the opportunity to defend the title. It's sad but it's time we face reality. Luck and chance have saved us in the past but this time, they were not on hand to save the day.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZIYRGX4fS_0/VHsh1oMr6uI/AAAAAAAABVc/20Z6Y0M3Iic/s640/blogger-image--1549472223.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZIYRGX4fS_0/VHsh1oMr6uI/AAAAAAAABVc/20Z6Y0M3Iic/s640/blogger-image--1549472223.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div>Minister, author and motivational speaker Myles munroe, wife and daughter were killed in a plane crash with some members of their ministerial crew. It was quite a loss seeing that he just preached about death in his church, a few days back. Also, Charles Bruce Chukwuma, popularly known as Chaz B, shockingly joined the saints this month. Chaz B was a motivational speaker, relationship expert and life coach. He always had a word for every situation that one might be faced with in life. He brought hope to a lot of people. With the departure of these great men, the world has lost heroes but heaven has gained angels. Like someone said, the best way to honor these men is to live the right way. May the souls of the faithful departed, rest in perfect peace.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7D-7HOkNsd4/VHshr_7F0aI/AAAAAAAABVE/G6VWe6Ch56M/s640/blogger-image--2121520511.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7D-7HOkNsd4/VHshr_7F0aI/AAAAAAAABVE/G6VWe6Ch56M/s640/blogger-image--2121520511.jpg"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div>The insurgents struck Kano this month with a bomb blast that has sent scores of men, women and children to their graves. The series of blasts left many injured and bedridden in the hospital. With the &nbsp;death toll now over 100, one cannot even begin to understand this madness that is fast becoming a norm. May the bereaved be comforted at this time.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Elections are in full gear, declarations left right and centre. Please register and collect your permanent voters card so you can exercise your right as a citizen of the country. Ensure that you protect your vote, we've wasted a lot of good opportunities in the past. I believe 2015 would be better.</div><div><br></div><div>It's been 230 days since the Chibok girls were kidnapped and you cannot imagine the emotional trauma their families must be going through. Let's keep hope alive surely they'll return safely.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-a2JdhZIxlFw/VHshuZ4QSkI/AAAAAAAABVM/KOBeu1LdCTg/s640/blogger-image--1343534124.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-a2JdhZIxlFw/VHshuZ4QSkI/AAAAAAAABVM/KOBeu1LdCTg/s640/blogger-image--1343534124.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div>Eleven months have gone by this year, with only one month left to end it. How has 2015 been for you? great? Not so great? Whether you fall in the former or latter category, I need you to understand that being alive this day is enough to be thankful for. Examine and scrutinize yourself in this coming month, outline your strengths and weaknesses, be truthful to yourself as we round up the year. Make plans for a better 2015 and watch it all come to fruition.</div><div><br></div><div>HAPPY NEW MONTH!!!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S: there's going to be a Diary giveaway this Christmas to a keen reader of this diary. Stay tuned ladies et gents, <i>'e fit be u oh'</i> :)</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Photo credit: google images, instagram.</div>
