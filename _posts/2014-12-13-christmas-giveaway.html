Dear Diary,<br /><div><br /></div><div><div>It's been a great year so far on this blog. A lot of changes and reformations took place. New sections on the blog; monthly reviews, photoblogs, poems (that I once dreaded like crazy...lol) and even #Almostabride&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>These things I'm thankful for couldn't have been possible without the keen follower-ship of ardent readers like you. Page views practically tripled beyond my expectations and for that I'm very grateful to y'all. For those days of writers' block and blank pages in this diary, I thank God for his directions. Words are not just enough to show my appreciation.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>In celebration of the holidays and also a way to say thank you to you, today being the 12th day of the 12th month of the year, yours truly would like to give a very dedicated follower of this blog, a box of 12 sumptuous cupcakes baked by her. Yeah, apart from writing, she bakes professionally (HQ!)</div><div><br /></div><div>To win the box of 12, you must be living in Lagos, Nigeria (I can't be crossing the 7 seas for you -_-) This cake is yours for the taking and eating, only snag there is that you have to answer a tiny-winy question :D</div><div><br /></div><div><b><i>"Which post on this blog has the &nbsp;highest number of page views?"</i></b></div><div><br /></div><div>This is an equal opportunity for everyone to win. Whether or not you have been following the diary, you can always go back and read through to see if you can guess the one with the highest number of page views.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is a giveaway question, ladies and gents. Make your answers known in the comment section if you can and if not, mail them to youngblackwoman@gmail.com and make momma proud :)</div><div><br /></div><div>The winner would be announced 12 days from today, that's the 24th day of December. So get reading people! Remember to tell a friend to tell a friend even as we spread the love this season.</div><div><br /></div><div>See y'all in 12 days.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
