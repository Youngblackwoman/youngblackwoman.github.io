Dear diary, it's the Sunday before Christmas, what are you thankful for? I have so many things to be thankful for but I'll save them for another post. Today we'll be talking about trust; it's (mis)use in our society today. 

Trust can be defined as the belief that someone or something is reliable, good, honest and effective. To trust is to have confidence in someone or something, to give the responsibility of doing something to someone. Some key words to note from the definition above include, *belief, confidence and responsibility.* Trust is a very big word, it carries a lot of weight. A lot of people use that word with so much levity, attaching little or no meaning to it. It is an everyday need in the society today; in relationships, businesses, marriages e.t.c. It's the most essential requirement for effective communication and it is the very foundation upon which some of the values we cherish (e.g love) are built upon.

*"Trust is the fruit of a relationship in which you know that you are loved"* **-Wm. Paul Young**

Trusting people is quite a risky venture; you have to actually trust them first of all, before you know if you can truly trust them. It's annoying right? I mean you could get either get hurt or pleased in the process but thats life; you'll never know until you try. Ideally, for you to trust someone, they must have shown you or proved to you in a certain way that they are capable of being trusted. Trust isn't a free gift that should be shared to every Tom, Dick and Harry, it's something that must be earned. If you go around trusting *anyone and everyone,* you'll get heart-broken. The basis of trust is truth. Honesty goes a long way in proving how reliable you can be, it shows that you are worth all the trouble that may come with trusting someone. If you want someone to trust you, you have to prove to them that you are worthy of their trust. It's not always about money, being there for someone when they are in need goes a long way in earning their trust.

The Ironic thing about trust is that it takes years to build but it could be destroyed in a few seconds. Even if we decided to pick up the pieces and move on with our lives, the indelible scar would always be there to remind you that such a person cannot be trusted. In the end the choice is yours, you have to choose whether or not you can trust someone. I hope I can trust you.

*"Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none"* **-William Shakespeare .**
