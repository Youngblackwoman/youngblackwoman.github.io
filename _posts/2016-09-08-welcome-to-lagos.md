What’s the first thought that comes to your mind when you hear the name Lagos? You may say good people, happy people, the good life and all those *stories that touch the heart.* For me, the first thing that comes to mind when I hear Lagos, is **Traffic**. If you are the type that is allergic to traffic (yes, there are people like that; they react to traffic by crying and complaining about it 24 hours of the day, 7 days a week) then Lagos is not the place for you.

Lagos and Traffic are two words that go together. The kind of relationship that exists between these two words can be likened to that of two peas in a pod, identical twins, the head and neck e.t.c. Traffic in Lagos is one like no other; while others may be free flowing, the reverse is the case here. It has been called all sort of names like go slow, bumper to bumper, hold up and so much more but they all have the same meaning. Have you ever been in the *Lekki-Ajah* Traffic? *Apapa* Traffic? *Ikorodu* road Traffic? *Ikeja* traffic? Traffic that will make you want to park your car on the road and just walk home, it can be very frustrating. The annoying part is that you manage to go through this traffic with all the forces against you and then you get to the front only to find out that there’s nothing causing it. There have been many theories (both physical and spiritual) as to what might be causing it e.g the tale of witches carrying out sacrifices on the road but that’s a story for another day.

One of the causes of traffic in Lagos is the number of cars on the road. Welcome to this part of the world where wealth is described by the amount of cars such a person can afford. In other climes, men and women board a bus/train so they can get to work on time, but here, having a car is more of a statement. If a family has 5 cars and all 5 cars are on the road every day, you can imagine what the roads will look like if every family was like that. The commercial bus drivers who stop in the middle of the road to pick up passengers are not helping matters either.

I think the government has tried to an extent by putting traffic lights and wardens to help relieve the traffic congestion but Lagosians don’t want to hear anything. The colors on the traffic light mean different things to Lagosians and I really can’t blame them, I think it’s the stress of work. For most of these Lagos Drivers, the color red means go, yellow means go and well green, means go too. People are becoming innovative and social media has become a useful tool in alleviating this crisis. We now have twitter handles/apps e.g @giditraffic, @trafficbutter etc, which help to identify the red spots (traffic routes) real time and also, provide alternative means which are more or less, traffic free. The addition of the Lagos state traffic management authority (LASTMA) by the government of the state has also helped to ensure free flow of traffic but recently some of the officials have left their duty posts to attend to unimportant things (to be continued on another episode of *Lagos na wah!*). The Bus rapid transit (BRT) system has also helped to reduce the number of yellow buses on the roads in a bid to ensure free flow of traffic.

Beyond the traffic situation that is Lagos, a lot of things happen in traffic; many have met their life partners there, eaten a full course meal (gala, coke and chips saving people since 1845), furnished their apartment with items bought on the way (from foot mat to ceiling fan) and even built up their music/movie collection with pirated discs bought in traffic. What is it that you are looking for? You are sure to find it in Lagos traffic.

To avoid being stuck in traffic, the following tips should help.
* 1)	Check traffic reports: live feeds are available on social media and the radio.
* 2)	Leave early: try to avoid rush hour traffic when everyone would be on the road e.g people going to school in the morning or at the close of work.
* 3)	Make proper plans: Be like yours truly who doesn’t just wake up and decide to go out. I have to make sure the area I’m going to is traffic free.
* 4)	Learn alternative routes: you never know when this will come in handy. It’s okay to learn new routes so you can avoid traffic. You may get lost in the process, but you’ll never forget your way again.
* 5)	Use the BRT: sometimes, the queue for the BRT may be insane but it’s a sure way to have a stress free ride to work. Leave the car at home sometimes and join the bus.

Recently, there have been reports of robberies in traffic and it’s getting worse by the day. I would love for you to be here next week for another episode of *Lagos na wah!.* So please stay safe out there. I hope you have learnt a few things about Lagos traffic. If there are other things to add, I would love to read them in the comment section. Keep your eyes open next time you are in traffic, I may just bump into you.

*Eko o ni baje, O baje ti!*
