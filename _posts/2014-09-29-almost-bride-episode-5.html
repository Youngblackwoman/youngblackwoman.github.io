There was a kind of peace and calm that she felt as she talked with him. She laughed like a hyena from time to time. She wasn't sure if the jokes were that funny but she laughed all the same.&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">They said their goodbyes for the night and Ihuoma went to bed feeling like a princess.</span></span></span></div><div class="s2"><br /></div><div class="s2"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">The calls became more frequent. From twice a day to about 8 times a day, but hey, who's counting? They talked about everything and anything. Her friends became his friends and his friends became her friends. They became closer and closer. He always made her laugh. He always looked forward to the end of work each day, where he would tell her about frustrating clients who weren't sure of what they wanted. She had her own stories to tell from the hospital but she preferred to listen to him as he poured out his heart to her. While they were saying their goodbye's&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">on one of such evenings,&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">he promised her a suprise during the week.&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">He always threw surprises at her and that endeared him to her. The first time he surprised her she was swooning in excitement for the greater part of the day.&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">The flowers&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">he&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">sent</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">practically blocked the entrance into her office. She wondered who would make such mistake of dropping a huge bouque</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">t</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;in front of her office. She saw the card on it and it read thus;</span></span></span></div><div class="s2"><br /></div><div class="s7" style="text-align: start;"><span class="s5" style="font-style: italic;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">"Roses are red, violets are blue</span></span></div><div class="s7" style="text-align: start;"><span class="s5" style="font-style: italic;"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">I look at the sky and all i see is you."</span></span></div><div class="s2"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); padding-left: 36px;">​</span></div><div class="s2"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">There was no name on the card but she knew who it was.

He was expecting one of his frustrating clients and he couldn't wait to get the contract over and done with. This particular client, Chief Eze, wore trouble on his head like a helmet and everybody avoided him like a plague. Why he always wanted Lekan to handle his deals for him, remained the&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">8th</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;wonder of the world to Lekan.</span></span></span></div><div class="s2"><br /></div><div class="s2"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">"Mr Lekan, how are you na?

The table&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">was adorned with scented candles and a ravishing centre piece.</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;The rice was garnished with sweet corn and greens.&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">The&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">sauté</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;vegetab</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">le</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;by the side was the reason I</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">huoma believed most people preferred to die as vegetarians.

After dinner,&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">they got into a play fight over who should hold the remote control to the TV. She finally got hold of it and h</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">e started chasing her&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">a</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">round the house.</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">He carried her in the air a couple of times and she kept screaming like a little child. His energy was amazing and she liked it.&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">He chased her a few more times then s</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">uddenly, his mood changed.&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">He dropped her on the couch</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;and sat still starring into space. She tried to nudge him back to reality but he started shouting at her, asking why she was in his house and who invited her. Ihuoma found it&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">amusing;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;after all</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">,</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;he was the one who invited her. She laughed it off and gave him the side eye. All the wine that night had filled Ihuoma's bladder. She ran off to the bathroom to empty it. By the time she returned, he&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">had entered</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;his study room. He always went there when he had some important work to do so Ihuoma&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">didn’t</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;bother to go there. She</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">slotted in the</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s5" style="font-style: italic;"><span class="bumpedFont15">House of cards</span></span><span class="s5" style="font-style: italic;"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">DVD</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;she saw on the table and tried to catch up on the episodes she had missed. Lekan came out at midnight to find her sleeping on the couch. He put off the TV and carried her into the roo</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">m. Like the gentleman that he was</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">, he allowed her to sleep in his master bedroom while he man</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">a</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">ged to get a shutter eye in the guest room.</span></span></span></div><div class="s2"><br /></div><div class="s2"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">Ihuoma heard the door creak but she wasn</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">’</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">t sure if it was in her dream or a reality. She confirmed it was reality when Lekan returned a few minutes past 7 a.m</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">. He&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">made it a duty to jog every morning and Ihuoma didn't see the need for it. His physique was okay and he wasn't over weight. She would never understand&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">his obsession with jogging</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">.&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">Even in moments of severe illness, he still found time and energy to make the rounds</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">.&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">She looked into his ward</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">robe searching for one of his rumpled shirts so she could throw it on.

After everyone had eaten their fill</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;and taken their leave</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">, Ihuoma cleared up and prepared for bed.
