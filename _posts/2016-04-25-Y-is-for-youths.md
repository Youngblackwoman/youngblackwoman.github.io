Dear diary, it feels good to be writing again. It hasn't been easy recovering from the *self-imposed* break but it sure has been fun. We are looking at Youth today and what better place to discuss the youths than on **THE DIARY OF A YOUNG BLACK WOMAN**? Despite the title of this post, it actually applies to everyone; those who are youths as a result of their age and those who are young at heart.

Youth may be defined as the period between childhood and adult age. It cannot be tied down to a specific age range as this would be limiting it's true value. Some have described it as an experience that may shape an individual's level of dependency. This experience may be influenced by lifestyle, culture, peers and gender. It is a phase of life in which a lot of questions are asked and ideas are running wild, all in a quest to find ourselves.

*"Don't laugh at youth for their affectations; they are only trying on one face after another to find their own."* **-Logan P. Smith**

Youth of today are faced with a lot of challenges such as unemployment, corruption, substance abuse and so much more. These challenges have always been a recurring decimal in the society but somehow a lot of people have been able to rise above it. It takes determination and willpower to choose to live a life different from the one you have been forced to live. Now is the time to make that choice, it's not a simple decision but it has to be made. There are a lot of reason's why the society will not take you serious (the major reason is because of your age) but once you can stand out from the crowd, they'll have no other choice.

*"If I am young and wrong, then you are right [to look down on my youthful ignorance.] But if I am young and right, what does my age matter?"* **-Antigone Aesculus**

Youths have an essential role to play in the society and it is of utmost importance that we begin to live up to that role. We should be at the forefront of the change we want to see. Instead of trying to pull ourselves apart, we must be united to make impact on the society at large. We must be willing to learn from past mistakes as this is the only way we can define our future. It can be heartbreaking seeing a youth do the exact thing that we constantly complain about in our leaders. We are the future leaders of tomorrow but there would be no future if we do not take care of today. There is so much to do at this stage in life but do not throw caution to the wind while trying to achieve your dreams. We should always remain aware of where our actions can lead us to in the future.

If you are old, you can be young at heart. Do what you want to do as long as you are able to do it. There should be communication between the young and old as this would help to give the former, a better outlook on life. Stay happy fulfilling your dreams because being a youth is a choice that can be made.

*"Young people, enjoy your youth. Be happy while you are still young. Do what you want to do, and follow your heart's desire. But remember that God is going yo judge you for whatever you do. Don't let anything worry you or cause you pain. You aren't going to be young very long."* **-Ecclesiastes 11:9-10**

We are learning...
