Dear diary,&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>How are you enjoying the weather? Since the rains have decided to take residence in this side of the world, we might as well relax and enjoy it while it lasts. Meanwhile, I have something important &nbsp;to discuss with you, do read.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-i-QTw_MnVC8/U8rhMiPFBrI/AAAAAAAAA5Y/p7MyS8hio6Y/s640/blogger-image--1546665917.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-i-QTw_MnVC8/U8rhMiPFBrI/AAAAAAAAA5Y/p7MyS8hio6Y/s640/blogger-image--1546665917.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div><br></div><div>They kept shouting her name but she just wouldn't turn. Obviously a 7 year old child like her should be able to answer her own name, what was wrong? She was unscrewing the handle of the tap and someone had to stop her before it would burst open. I was the closest to her so I walked up to her and tapped her but she wouldn't budge. I had to force her hand off the tap before she finally let go.</div><div><br></div><div>Her hair was cut low like some of her peers that came with her. She had 2 legs, 2 eyes, 2 hands, 2 ears, 2 nostrils and other normal features of the human body. One peculiar thing I noticed is that she smiled more than the others did, revealing some missing teeth. She had a flat face and she opened her mouth more often revealing her tongue which was larger than normal and she salivated a lot. As she walked back to her seat, I noticed that she couldn't walk in a straight line, she walked like she just started learning how to. She looked restless and really enjoyed playing and running about the place. I didn't hear her talk much, but she kept making incoherent sounds.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There was something special about this child because everybody kept looking at her.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) is a genetic disorder involving an extra chromosome. This extra chromosome is responsible for the physical growth delays, manual dexterity problems, certain facial characteristics we see in special people. The incidence of births of children with Down syndrome increases with the age of the mother. They are also called special needs people because they require more attention and care than the average human being.</div><div><br></div><div>The society looks at the birth of a child with Down syndrome as a curse upon the family. This alone is one of the many reasons why some mothers abandon such children in the hospitals and bushes. Others do so out of fear of the challenges that may come in the long run. Some parents hide the special child at home and carry the other children to the beach to have fun. Socio-developmentally speaking, that child gets worse. Special people may have issues with making friends therefore the family is the most important unit in that child's life and as such they should not be segregated.</div><div><br></div><div>They usually have an intelligence quotient of about 50 meaning they'll usually function like kids half their age. These special people may not be able to compete intellectually with their age mates, but they can be &nbsp;very creative. They usually have an inkling for the arts and athletics.</div><div><br></div><div>Have you recently discovered that your child is a special child? Don't fret. There would be challenges and moments of frustration but they will pass. Early intervention programes with speech therapists, occupational therapists e.t.c should be implemented by the parents. The cost of bringing up such a child can be nerve wrecking, time-wise and financially speaking, but it's important to do so with love and hope.You have been given the responsibility of bringing up a child that the society may frown upon, you might as well do the job beautifully and prove them wrong. No, you are not being punished by God for your sins in the past, You are only being used as an instrument of grace in that child's life. He will not give you more than you can take, so you better believe that you are more than equal to task ahead.</div><div><br></div><div>Dear 'society', in your moments of stigmatization and unjust dislike towards these special people, try and put yourself in their shoes and try to see the world through their eyes. Maybe, just maybe, you'll have a changed heart. Show love to them, they are people too. There are ignorant ones amongst us, people that don't know that special children are people like us and not witches or wizards, it's our duty to shed more light and correct these ideologies on the spot.</div><div><br></div><div>Dear parents, please don't hide &nbsp;your child at home, expecting a miracle to happen. Take them out to see things, let them go to school and see children like them. Don't be afraid to take them to the hospital when you discover something you are not comfortable with. Discuss with other parents and find out how they are coping. Education, quality health care and a caring society would give a special child the much needed happiness and strength to cruise through life's journey. You as a parent should strive to make these requirements available.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>At the moment, it seems frustrating and tiring, taking care of the special one but one day you will look back and smile, forever grateful that you raised a special child.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Are you living with a special child? Do you know one? How has the journey been so far? Please share your stories and encourage others.</div><div><br></div></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">*Photo credit: Google</span></div>
