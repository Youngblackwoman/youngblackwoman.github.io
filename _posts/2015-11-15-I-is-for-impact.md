Distinguished ladies et gentlemen of the diary, how are you doing this fine Monday morning? have you learnt anything from our Alphabetical series so far? It's all in a quest to create a better society for us all. We are moving on to the value of the 9th alphabet today, I is for Impact.

Living in a society like ours, our survival instincts as humans drives us into different spheres of our lives. We interact with different people every day in our work place, schools, hospitals, the market place and even in traffic. There's almost a 95% chance that you'll meet a new person every single day. When you meet these people, do they go away remaining the same? What new thing did you, directly or indirectly, add to their life?

The Merriam-Webster dictionary meaning of impact kind of summarizes why we are here. According to her, *to impact is to have a powerful or major influence or effect.* Impact can be effected in 2 ways; either a bad way or a good way. It's really a choice which way you want to go. Everything you do in this life has some effect. Don’t think you are too small to make an impact, even the ant as tiny as it is has shown us a couple of life survival tips.

Last week, I visited my cobbler. I say my cobbler because I've been dealing with him for about 4 years now. I've changed location a couple of times during these 4 years but I always go back to him when the need arises. Now it’s not like I can't find any cobbler around but the truth is that no one takes care of my shoes like he does. I gave him a pair of shoes to repair for me and he did a beautiful job *(as always)*. I asked him how much, he smiled *(as always)* and said the amount then added; *"if you think it's too much ma, you can give me what you think is okay"*. I shook my head in surprise remembering when I gave a different cobbler my shoe to repair a couple of months back. He did a shoddy job and was even arguing with me on how much I should pay him,  how sad! I smiled back at my cobbler, gave him the amount he asked for and thanked him again. It looks like it's not a big deal but this level of humility just surprises me- that right there is Impact. As a result of this, I've decided to take life easy and be contented with what I have. This cobbling job is all he has but he is very good at it. These deeds unbeknownst to him, is making a difference and that is what we should all strive to do.

No one really knows how much impact they are having on others but with time, its effect is seen. Like the popular saying goes, a life is not important except it has an impact on other lives. You can’t truly say you are successful unless you have made a difference in someone’s life. There a lot of people looking for a manual to this tunnel called life, anything to direct them and your life may be just be the manual that they are reading. How are you going to influence them? Why should people come in contact with you and remain the same? Why should they work with you in the same environment and not be changed for the better? Impacts lives and make a change; let someone say because of you I did this. You don't have to spend the whole day with them, even 5 minutes is a lot. It may be a word, it may be your actions, as long as a message is passed across, do it. I remember talking to someone a few months ago and he had his mouth open for the greater part of the conversation. It was a random convo but he saw some things differently after that. I am not perfect but I’m constantly learning every day that it’s the little deeds that actually count.

If we want to see a change in our society, we need to start impacting each other. It’s our responsibility to create an environment that would be favorable for the proper growth of our children. In the words of Late Chaz-b, *"if each one can reach one and each one can teach one, what a beautiful country, Nigeria would be".*

We are learning...
