Hmmm… how time flies. 2013 started with mixed feelings for me because I didn’t know how I would face the year. At the beginning of the year, I had a lot of things on my plate to achieve. Some were carried over from last year but I was determined to move forward. Being an undergraduate, academics was and is still a priority. Combining school with other extracurricular activities can be really stressful especially when you are not a guru at multi-tasking because at a point, failure in one aspect looks like failure in all aspects even when you are not doing so badly.<br /><br />Six months may seem like a really short time to learn things that will be useful throughout your life time but trust me it seemed like forever. However I have learnt some valuable stuff that I would like to share. Here are a few:<br /><br />A book and its cover:<br />&nbsp;A human being is like a book. The physical attributes and character that we see can be likened to the cover of a book, while the inner mind of a human is the replica of the content and pages of that book. The people who look innocent most times are the guilty ones while the ones that look guilty are actually sheeps in wolf clothing. Moral of the story is: don’t judge a book by its cover.<br /><br />Beneath that smile:<br />Always happy, not saying much. Smiles at every greeting. People have a lot of issues within and around them but because of how desperately wicked the heart of man is, they cannot share their problems. They bottle it up inside them and even though they cry in their private time, they still manage to smile back when you greet. To me these are the strongest set of beings to walk this earth. Can you see beneath that smile?<br /><br />&nbsp;I.O.U’s:<br />&nbsp;It means exactly that.. I Owe You. You must have at least one of them in your life. Always asking about your wellbeing and granting you unmerited favours and support. Well in the end they usually want something in return, something you can’t part with. Other than our father in heaven, I am yet to come across one that would have a persons interest at heart in all aspects without wanting something in return. The stories are all the same. They may not collect it immediately and years may roll by but surely they’ll be back.<br /><br />Doing it well:<br />“Whatever is worth doing is worth doing well, make hay while the sun shines, a stitch in time save nine… e.t.c.” Very popular proverbs that still apply to this day and time. If you are going to do something, you might as well do it well. If you have set your mind on a task, do not be lazy about it. Put in all your efforts to produce a fantastic result that you can be proud of. Only then can you sit back in your rocking chair and say to yourself “not bad, not bad at all”<br /><br />Setting priorities:<br />Don’t jumble things together hoping they would sort themselves out. Set your priorities. Know what you want and do not want. Life is easier to live when you take one step at a time. Identify your priorities so you won’t be likened to the man that knows he is sick with leprosy, but he abandons it to look for a cure for that tiny patch of eczema on his skin… Seriously?!<br /><br />I learnt quite a lot but that’s the little I can share. I am walking into the second half with my eyes wide open, expecting anything. I’m taking my lessons with me ready to battle it out this time. Remember the routine of a football match. The players play the first half and go in during half-time to re-strategise. They come back in the second half more aggresive, ready to win at all costs not minding what the opposing teams throws at them. (Just like Italy and Uruguay are struggling for third place at the confederations cup at the moment….goodluck guys )<br /><br />It dosent really matter what you set as your new years resolution at the beginning of the year, half time is almost up. Re-strategise and enter the second half of the year battle ready. Above all things, be wise.<br /><br />Impossibility is nothing!<br /><br />Gracias
