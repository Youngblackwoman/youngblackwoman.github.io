At this moment you might be thinking that I have lost it but hey,  research has shown &nbsp;that everyone is allowed 5 minutes of madness  everyday. It all started when I was watching an episode of keeping up  with the kardashians. In this episode, kim was playfully thrown into the  river by her fiancée Kris and then she discovered that she had  misplaced her earings. She came out of the water crying and people were  surprised at her action because it was just an “EARING”. She said that  she was crying because the earing cost her 75,000 dollars and she just  got them recently. I also lambasted her because I was wondering why a  human being would cry that hard for something that can be replaced…I did  not try to put myself in her shoes.</span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-indent: 36pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Then  the next day, I had my own “kim” moment. I was sent on an errand to the  bank to pay in some money and I was in a hurry because I did not want  the bank to close before me. I quickly took a shower and was trying to  dress up when I found out that my shirt was not ironed. I rushed to the  room and put on the iron with the hope that it would heat up while I was  getting ready. After a while I went back to iron my shirt and without  checking the heat I placed it on my shirt……...”Aaaarrrgghh” was all that  came out when I opened my mouth. My beautiful shirt was no more because  It had been burnt. I could not cry because no one was at home to listen  to me but then I started laughing when I remembered kim’s earing. The  same way I insulted her because she was crying for her earing &nbsp;is the  same way some of you reading this would insult me because I was sad  about the burnt shirt. </span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-indent: 36pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Well  it’s a case of different strokes for different folks because what  you’ll hold dear to your heart may be something I’ll just overlook. My  shirt might not be as expensive as kim’s earings but then I liked my  shirt a lot. The lesson here is that it is not cool to pass judgement on  people so quickly without hearing their side of the issue. A lot of  times when we hear stories about people we don’t even know from Adam or  even those we are close to, we just write them off without trying to put  ourselves in their shoes or even see them through God’s eyes (which is  just and fair by the way). At least everyone deserves a chance to  explain themselves. The moral of the story is that we should learn to be  patient and not be too quick to pass judgement on people unless you can  put yourself in their shoes because “it is he that wears the shoe that  knows where it pinches him”.</span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So my new motto is "what you don’t want people to do to you, don’t do  to other people". Also, at the end of the day kim found her earing at  the bottom of the river but my shirt was burnt beyond repair *crying*.</span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><br /></div><br /><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">FEEL FREE TO DROP YOUR COMMENTS AND CRITICISMS…….gracias!</span></span>
