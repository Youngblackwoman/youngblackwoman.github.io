Dear diary, I know what you are about to say, i even said it to myself before typing this post so don't say it. Yes, L is for love. It has to be for love, what else would we rather talk about? I do not claim to be an expert on this subject matter, the only manual I have on it is the bible and it pretty much explains all we need to know about it.

We are not using Merriem-Webster to define Love today, we are taking its definition *straight outta* the holy book, *"Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on it's own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, endures all things. Love never ends...".*  This definition is as clear as it can be; giving us the very attributes that we should possess so we can fully express our love to each other. We'll be looking at each one of them so we can have a better understanding of it.

**Love is patient and kind**
This characteristic of love is very important if you want to remain in love. When we fall in love, it's with someone other than ourselves. This person grew up differently from the way you did so it's understandable for the person to do/say things that you are not familiar with. Thats when patience is needed. You have to learn to be patient with this person even when you are frustrated. Don't pressurise your partners and chase them away, learn to be patient. Understand that this person is different from who you are, so be kind enough to correct them if you think they are out of line and patiently wait for them to learn the right thing.

**Love does not envy or boast, it is not arrogant or rude.**
Don't be jealous of your partner because he/she is better at something than you are. Don't be jealous that the person is attracting members of the opposite sex, instead be grateful that you are the chosen one out of the lot. Support your partner in whatever it is that wants to make you envious and that way you'll get over it. Don't be proud or boastful in relating to your partner, you are belittling them. Humble yourself and watch as you both grow in love. Even if you are *used to it* because you are in love now, that has to change. You cannot claim to be in love and still be arrogant in your dealings with them, it doesn't work that way. Anger is not even an excuse for such rude behaviour because you are going to be living with this person for a long time. You have to devise a means to remain calm even when pushed to anger. Love is not proud, it makes you apologise when you have done something wrong. You are in love with a human and not a thing, respect their feelings.

**Love does not insist on it's own way; it is not irritable or resentful**
Like i mentioned earlier, you are falling in love with someone that is different in some ways from you. The person want's things done in a particular way but because you don't agree with it, you insist on your own way. That isn't love.  You should be able to reach a compromise with your partner. Listen to his/her own point of view and you'll see that there's some level of wisdom in it. This act of listening is enough to keep you in love. You may not have gotten what you wanted but you have kept the love in your relationship.

**Love does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth**
Don't rejoice in your partner's failure or sadness. You should be a pillar of support to your partner even in their lowest moments. Rejoice with them when they succeed and comfort them when they fail. Love is very important at times like that and that's what helps it to grow. Always encourage them to do the right thing and watch as they remain grateful to you for that.

**Love bears all things, believes all things, endures all things**
Yes, you may not agree with it but you can't change the truth. If you want to remain in love with your partner, you have to bear it all; the joys, the pains, everything. You have to believe all things; trust your partner even when the situation around you leaves much to be desired. No one ever said it was going to be easy but as long as you are in love with your partner, you have to endure a lot of things.

**Love never ends...**
I always wonder what happened when someone says, "I *loved* him/her". True love never ends; you may be angry for a while but you shouldn't fall out of love with the person. Just like our father in heaven who loves us, despite our troubles, we should learn to love despite it all.

Phew! I have talked about love so many times but I'm still learning about it, every single day. I may not be *qualified* to talk about this topic as extensively as i have just done but if we really read it in depth and apply it to our daily lives, I know things will change for the better. Yes, Love isn't enough sometimes for all we want but that is a topic for another day. The moment you notice that you are loosing any of the above attributes, that's a sign that you are falling out of love with your partner. If you really want your relationship to work, work on the characteristics that you are lacking. Love doesn't just happen in the twinkling of an eye, it grows. Be patient enough to learn about your partner in love so you can have a beautiful relationship. Love conquers all.

*So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.* **-1 Corinthians  13:13**

We are learning...
