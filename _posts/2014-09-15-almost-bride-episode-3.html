The last time he saw them together, it didn't end on a good note. Jacob had dated Lala a couple of months back and the experience had left her with a broken heart and he knew it. Lala met Jacob at a yo</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">uth seminar where they were on the same team. He wasn't exactly the take your breath away kind of guy but his impeccable speech and smartness could send a girl to cloud nine. He was the leader of her team and they only had a formal relationship. When he c</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">a</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">lled her a day after the seminar, she was surprised. She was even more surprised when he asked her out to lunch. He was a smooth talker and so it wasn't difficult convincing her to go on a date with him.&nbsp; That was the beginning of a beautiful relationship,</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;or so it was meant to be. Their relationship grew and was the envy of all. She heard stories about him from outsiders but she didn't pay attention to them. Some said he was a player while others said he was up to no good, but all that didn't stop her. A</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">s&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">long as he loved her, that was all she needed. During the course of the relationship, Lala got pregnant for him. When she told Jacob that they were expecting a baby, his countenance changed immediately. He denied the pregnancy vehemently and this hurt her&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">badly. She wasn't ready to bring a child into this cold hearted world without a father, so she decided to abort the baby. She couldn't bring herself to tell her friends what had happened because she felt she was a disappointment. It wasn't until she was</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;al</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">most dead on the operating table due to post abortion complications that she asked the doctor to call Ihuoma. Ihuoma was burnt and angry inside when she heard the whole story but she had to fake a smile for Lala's sake. Ihuoma called Anini and together the</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">y visited Jacob in the office. They had thought the shouting and embarrassment they dealt Jacob that day would make him sober but here he was, trying to rope another lady in. Truly,a leopard doesn't change it</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">'</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">s spots.</span></span></span></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 0px;"><br></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">"Hi ladies", he replied looking aw</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">ay.&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">Ihuoma couldn't restrain herself, all the anger turned into words as she rained curses on him.</span></span></span></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 0px;"><br></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">"So you are here again?

The straw that broke the camel's back revealed itself when he tried to defend himself. Lala who had been quiet all the while, was disgusted by his utterances. She picked up his wine glass&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">and e</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">mptied it on his sparkling white shirt. They took their leave and the lady he was trying to have a conversation with hurried after them. Inside the car, they tried to console Lala who was in tears. She remembered all she had to go through to recover from t</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">he emotional and physical damage done to her just because she loved somebody who didn't give a hoot about her. The event of that night had stirred up buried memories and she couldn't fight back the tears. Dona who ran after them was silent all the wh</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">ile. S</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">he was just observing the whole scenario quietly but deep down, she was grateful to these 3 lovely women who had rescued her from the claws of Jacob. She smiled to herself as she knew it was only the beginning of a long lasting relationship.</span></span></span></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 0px;"><br></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">Ihuoma woke&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">up by 7:10 a.m the next day. She had only 50 minutes to arrive&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">a</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">t</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;the clinic and she hadn't had her bath. Chinedu was going to be by her gate, blaring his car horn by 7:30 and she had to be ready by then. He had been picking her up to work for the p</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">ast 5 w</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">eeks and it had really helped her. It all started when her car developed a fault and it had to be brought back to life at the mechanic's. It was on a 2 weeks sabbatical leave and she had to find an alternative means to work. Chinedu had been her co worker&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">since she started work at Ripples Hospital but it wasn't until one of her late nights at the hospital, all in a bid to escape traffic, that she met him. He was a senior colleague that doubled as a senior registrar at the state Teaching Hospital. It</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;was on&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">one of such nights that she discovered that they lived in the same estate in Surulere. A few trips to and fro the office and they found out that they had a lot in common. They both loved Maxwell, the musician and they chanted his tunes most of the time on&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">their way from work. They both loved to party and have fun so much that when it came to hospital matters, their manner of expertise dazed their colleagues. They became so fond of each other that she waited patiently for him to ask her out but it n</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">ever happ</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">ened. He kept sending mixed signals and she decided to take the ones that appealed to her, she wouldn't let what</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">happen</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">e</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">d</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;to her and Femi repeat itself. On a good day, he could ask her out to lunch and in her dating book, that was a plus. On some other&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">day, he would ignore her and snob her but she would term it as him "having a bad day."</span></span></span></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 0px;"><br></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">The car horn blared again and Ihuoma knew that if she didn't get to the car immediately, public transport would be her ticket to work that morning. She got in</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">to the car</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;and gave him her usual innocent smile that could break down any china wall of anger. His chubby face couldn't hide his dimple when he smiled. Being tall and fair, he would be a typical take home to "her" mama, kind of guy. The fact that he was Igbo, was t</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">he icing on the cake. Ihuoma day dreamed about the day that they would be married. Her bouquet of flowers would be filled with fresh red and white roses and she would wear a cathedral veil. He never really put a name to what was going on between</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;them but s</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">he silently prayed it would be in her favor. As she powdered her face, looking into the car mirror she could see he looked worried.</span></span></span></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 0px;"><br></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">"Nedu, what's wrong?"&nbsp; "Nothing Rita... Sorry, Ihuoma. I'm fine Ihuoma."&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 0px;"><br></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">This was the 3rd time in 2 weeks he had called</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;her that name. Rita was the name of his ex-girlfriend. When she asked about the relationship and what caused their break up, he always gave surface answers. He claimed that they had irreconcilable differences and they had to go their separate&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">ways. He nev</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">er really said much about her but he always reiterated the fact that he was over her. That was all the assurance that she needed. The hospital wasn't as busy as it would be on a normal day. School had resumed so the children were back in school and the par</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">ents were at work. A few patients came for their monthly check up and some others</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">,</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;for mild illnesses. Ihuoma decided to visit Chinedu in his office. He didn't look happy to see her but she was happy to see him. Ideally, office romance or in th</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">is case, hosp</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">ital romance was unethical coupled with the fact that he was a senior colleague and she was just a medical officer but Ihuoma couldn't care less.</span></span></span></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 0px;"><br></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15" style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">"Nedu, why are you frowning now?"

Are we not working in this same place? Lighten up joor."

They ate in silence and from time to time she would catch him looking at her and she would blush.
