Dear diary, how are you doing this fine Thursday morning? Today's post is one that is quite dear to my heart, I hope it speaks to you just like it did to me. Yes, my posts are for me too, aren't we all here to learn? Enjoy as you read *:)*

Has anyone ever walked up to you and asked "what are your values?" and you were stunned by the question? Well, that was me a few years ago. I actually opened my opened my mouth to answer the question but the words were not forthcoming. I was hearing some things in my head but you know that saying that goes, *"It is better to keep your mouth closed and let people think you are a fool than to open it and remove all doubt",* yeah, I decided to keep quiet. The truth is prior to the question being asked, I had never really thought about my values. Don't get it wrong, those who know me (*hi guys*) know that there's something that guides my perspective of life but I just could not put a name to it. These *things* that guide the way I act and react, I've never really found a reason to name/tag them until I was asked the question.

From a layman's perspective, Values are guiding principles that sum up our personalities. They are clear and precise rules/standards that we live by, which  ought not to be compromised. Values may be personal, religious or social but one thing common to these different types of values is their primary aim, which is to guide an individual. Examples of these Values include: honesty, dignity, justice, friendship, diligence, self-respect, trust, wisdom, the list is endless.

It's easy to live a carefree life; one without principles, but the consequences of such living is just too dangerous for anyone venturing that path. Values go a long way in affecting our behaviour and influencing the choices that we make. They help to give you a more defined path for this maze-tunnel called life. There are days when you may not feel like a 100%, maybe life struggles are weighing you down, your values would come in handy at that point in time as they will help to put you back on track.

If you do not have personal values that guide you, it's not too late. You can start off by understanding who you are as a person and what you hope to achieve in life. Take for instance, if you want to become a Doctor, you know that you have to be diligent, hard working, intelligent, passionate, e.t.c because these values play a significant role in the medical school journey. That's how values are discovered; identify values that are in line with what you want to achieve. Now these values may not be easy to keep up with because of the human nature within us, therefore you have to prioritize according to what works for you. Every other medical student may have these values but what works for Dayo may not work for Tayo (I just felt the need to rhyme with the names). Find the value that you *speaks* to you and follow it, as time goes on, you'll be able to add more to the list. With time you may feel the need to change/upgrade your value system and it is okay to do so. Anything that'll push you a step further towards your goal, is a welcome development anytime.

Do not seek to be like others, identify your values and stand out from the crowd. These values ought not to be compromised so you should strive to stick to them. It'll take a lot of self-discipline on your part to achieve your goal but trust me, it'll be worth it.

What are your Values? do share with me :).

We are learning...
