Dear diary, we are in December!!! Yeah, I get excited about this time of the year because it means Christmas is around the corner. It also means that we are gradually coming to the end of the alphabetical series. Today, we would be looking at the letter M. Like I did with the letter F, I will be discussing more than one value. Issues concerning Marriage, Money and Manners are some of the things that always come up in our daily lives and it's important that we talk about them.

**MARRIAGE**
When a man and a woman decide to come together in marriage, it's supposed to be for better or for worse but these days it's like a different ball game entirely. The rate of divorce these days is quite alarming. It's so high that you ask yourself, did they not know each other before getting married? You may say you want to learn about someone, hence the long courtship but the truth is that whether it's 10 years or 10 days, a pig would always return to it's sty. When dating, it's all about you and your partner, you are the one that's going to be living with him/her forever. If there are certain things you aren't comfortable with, discuss the issues and try and work them out before getting married. Don't expect the person to *change* in the marriage, if you can't deal with it then back off before you get to the altar.  Ever wonder why a certificate is given at the beginning of the marriage and not at the end? It's because this institution called marriage is one you never graduate from. You don't wake up one day and decide to walk out of it because of some petty reason like, *"he no longer has money and i can't cope"* or *"she has changed, she is now fat and ugly"* haba! This was someone you promised the world at some point in the union, what changed? In those moments of anger and frustration, remember why you married the person in the first place. Love always wins.

**MONEY**
When Mr Incredible released that song in the fall of 2008, many were just dancing to the beautiful rhythm of the song but he asked a very important question in that song, *"money slow to enter, money quick to go, where money dey go?"*. Not a few people are anxious about *pay-day* as it draws near, I mean who doesn't like money? We get paid on Friday and before Monday, the money is gone; where did the money go to? It's important that we learn to save money even in this youthful stage of our lives because it goes a long way in preparing us for our future. A woman I admire a lot once told me to make sure I always save, before I spend and not the other way around. So far, it has helped me even though I still strive everyday to resist the urge to spend unnecessarily. We are all work in progress and we can only get it right by trying. You don't always have to buy what you want, our wants are insatiable and would always be there so what are you going to do about it?. Save a little today so you can spend (wisely) later.

**MANNERS**
I would love us to talk about this extensively because it seems like a lot of people are lacking it these days. In my first post on this series [A is for ATTITUDE](http://thediaryofayoungblackwoman.com/2015/06/08/a-is-for-attitude.html), I mentioned a few points that would further guide your understanding of this topic. Manners is a term that may be preceded with the word good or bad, it depends on which of them you plan to stick with. From our daily conversations with people to our behaviour at the dinning table, manners are an integral aspect of our lives. In exhibiting good manners, you show others that you respect and care about them. It's also a means of setting a good example for others to emulate, encouraging them to treat others in a similar way. 


We are learning...
