<div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Dear Diary,</span></div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EgQr-DzC1dM/U7Kq_UsidyI/AAAAAAAAA4U/-pOkWXG-Lqo/s640/blogger-image-210268142.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EgQr-DzC1dM/U7Kq_UsidyI/AAAAAAAAA4U/-pOkWXG-Lqo/s640/blogger-image-210268142.jpg"></a></div></div><div><br></div><div>It has been a while we interacted on this space, how are you doing?</div><div><br></div><div>Every month of the year holds different memories for different people. Birthdays and anniversaries are being celebrated. Another month has come to end. The month of June ended well for some, while for others, it is a month they would gladly wish away. What rocked and sucked in the month of June? Find out.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-b1t7CinrDQs/U7KrGMCb61I/AAAAAAAAA4k/-SDGvHxNTsU/s640/blogger-image--866102979.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-b1t7CinrDQs/U7KrGMCb61I/AAAAAAAAA4k/-SDGvHxNTsU/s640/blogger-image--866102979.jpg"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div></div></div><div>His eminence, Alhaji Sanusi Lamido Sanusi emerged as the new emir of Kano, following the death of Ado Bayero who was on the throne for about 51 years. Mixed reactions have continued to trail the investiture, still the diary wishes him a peaceful reign.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4MOwaTR0iN0/U7KrH0x6hmI/AAAAAAAAA4s/9dZ0R0NMCnY/s640/blogger-image--520334871.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4MOwaTR0iN0/U7KrH0x6hmI/AAAAAAAAA4s/9dZ0R0NMCnY/s640/blogger-image--520334871.jpg"></a></div></div><div><br></div><div>Former Director General of NAFDAC and one time Minister of Information, &nbsp;Prof. Dora Akunyili died on the 7th of June after about 2 years battle with cancer. Branama crooner (Kefee Don momoh) passed away on Friday the 13th. May their gentle souls rest in perfect peace and may our dear Lord comfort the bereaved.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The MTV MAMA awards took place on Saturday 7 June with Nigerians carting away most of the award. Also, the BET (Black Entertainment Television) awards took place this month too. Congrats to the nominees, you are all winners.</div><div><br></div><div>Ekiti governorship elections took place on the 21st of June with PDP's Peter Fayose coming out victorious. The incumbent governor, Kayode Fayemi was voted out. I must commend INEC for the free and fair election conducted. Another reminder that 2015 is around the corner.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1OHnWCoPHt4/U7KrErYYeFI/AAAAAAAAA4c/Py0OxyBxPB0/s640/blogger-image-708250298.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1OHnWCoPHt4/U7KrErYYeFI/AAAAAAAAA4c/Py0OxyBxPB0/s640/blogger-image-708250298.jpg"></a></div></div></div><div><br></div><div>Is the ongoing 2014 World Cup the &nbsp;mother of all world cups yet? Defending champions Spain, were humiliated in a 5-1 loss to Netherlands. Phenomenal Goalkeeper, Iker Cassilas was not in his best of forms at this tournament. The mighty are fallen is my preferred theme for this tournament. Top countries like Spain, England, Portugal and Italy are being shown the way out by the "underdogs". Our very own Super eagles fought a good fight for the better part of the tournament. Even though they were knocked out in the round of 16, we are proud of them. Coach Stephen Keshi has bowed out from the super Eagles camp and the Captain, Joseph Yobo has hung the boots for the national team. With their various achievements for the country, they will not be forgotten. We wish them success in their endeavors. As for Vincent Enyeama, the elastic band that held the team together regardless of the manner in which they played, God bless you.</div><div><br></div><div>Did I forget to talk about the bombings and unjust killings in the country? No I didn't. It's quite sad having to recount such ugly incidents In a once peaceful nation like ours. The last week in June was a very sad one for Nigeria. Virtually every day of that week has the blood of innocent Nigerians killed in the most gruesome manner hanging on it. Bomb blast at Banex Plaza, Wuse, Abuja. 21 dead, several others injured. Killing of about 48 people in a church near Chibok, The genocide in Kano. Explosion at Apapa, Lagos. Conflicting reports on whether it was a tanker explosion or a failed suicide bomb attempt. Too many stories, Lord help us.</div><div><br></div><div>The Chibok girls are still missing, it's over 70 days and nobody is talking about it anymore. The countries that offered to help us have not been able to yield any tangible result. The Malaysian plane MH370 is still missing and not a clue in site. It is a different thing knowing the fate of a loved one but when you don't know where they are, what has happened to them or what they may be going through, it can be nerve wrecking.</div><div><br></div><div>The first half of the year is over and it has been a rough one. Remember when you were in church on the 31st of December, 2013, praying for more blessings and favor in the new year? Well that new near is fast coming to an end. You had a lot of resolutions written down on January 1, 2014, how is that faring? Have you been consistent with them or did you do away with them in the 2nd month of the year? Whatever the case may be don't fret, you still &nbsp;have 6 months to go. You have to sit up if you desire to achieve those set goals. Diligence, hard work and principles would guide you to achieve them. You have been motivated, please cast off the spirit of procrastination within you and set to work. It's your life and you are responsible for the choices you make. Make smart choices and reap the fruits by the end of the year.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>HAPPY NEW MONTH.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
