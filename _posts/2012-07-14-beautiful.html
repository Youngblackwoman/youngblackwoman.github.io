<span class="hasCaption">Hello ladies and gents.....</span><br /><span class="hasCaption">I saw this story and i could not resist the urge to share it with you all</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gpKPDmSSka0/UAHdjMeJOII/AAAAAAAAAEE/rP18CPBUHLU/s1600/426287_241036045991156_1722608567_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gpKPDmSSka0/UAHdjMeJOII/AAAAAAAAAEE/rP18CPBUHLU/s320/426287_241036045991156_1722608567_n.jpg" width="233" /></a></div><br /><span class="hasCaption">Twin girls, Brielle and Kyrie, were born 12  weeks ahead of their due date. Needing intensive care, they were placed  in separate incubators.<br /> <br />  Kyrie began to gain weight and her  health stabilized. But Brielle, born only 2 lbs, had trouble breathing,  heart problems and other complications. She was not expected to live.<br /> <br />  Their nurse did everything she could to make Brielle’s health better,  but nothing she did was helping her. With nothing else to do, their  nurse went against hospital policy and decided to place both babies in  the same incubator.<br /> <br />  She left the twin girls to sleep and when  when she returned she found a sight she could not believe. She called  all the nurses and doctors and this is what they saw (refer to the  picture above). <br /> <br />  As Brielle got closer to her sister, Kyrie  put her small little arm around her, as if to hug and support her  sister. From that moment on, Brielle’s breathing and heart rate  stabilized and her health became normal.<br /> <br />  From then on, they decided to keep both babies together, because when they were together they kept each other alive.</span><br /><br /><span class="hasCaption">WOW!....&nbsp; Now is this beautiful or is this BEAUTIFUL...</span>
