Dear diary,&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6lPFZKIPfyY/VWxLLL5HQ5I/AAAAAAAABm8/oxZKzKzj3Jg/s640/blogger-image-265281057.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6lPFZKIPfyY/VWxLLL5HQ5I/AAAAAAAABm8/oxZKzKzj3Jg/s640/blogger-image-265281057.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div>From my last post, you now have an idea of how the election process went. I'm sure you want to know what the outcome was. After voting, what's next? This post will answer your question.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tv2csam7lzw/VSKp61Y1urI/AAAAAAAABko/3FJyXsiFLJ0/s640/blogger-image--1771139947.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tv2csam7lzw/VSKp61Y1urI/AAAAAAAABko/3FJyXsiFLJ0/s640/blogger-image--1771139947.jpg"></a></div></div></div><br></div><div>According to the INEC chairman, Professor Attahiru Jega, the results of the election would be announced within 48 hrs of the voting process. The results were not announced 48 hours after but the coalition process had begun. The hours that followed the voting process were probably the longest hours ever for most Nigerians. People were having palpitations and blood pressures were skyrocketing. Up until the 28th of March this year, some Nigerians had no idea that local tv stations existed on their decoders. But following the elections of that day, come and see them flipping through local tv stations like it was going out of fashion. They were even the ones breaking news from tv stations on social media. Weekly TV series and Nollywood movies took the back seat as Nigerians became Political analysts; analyzing what was and what wasn't.</div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">Prof. Jega announced that the cumulated result from each state would be announced live on tv from 12 noon the following Monday. As a result of that announcement, shops and offices closed (that's if they even opened) very early that day. Everybody was rushing home just to watch Prof. Jega live on tv, announcing the result of the election.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XP6lcKf3H98/VSKqKlAOdsI/AAAAAAAABk4/ZV3CSPoh7y0/s640/blogger-image-555148872.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XP6lcKf3H98/VSKqKlAOdsI/AAAAAAAABk4/ZV3CSPoh7y0/s640/blogger-image-555148872.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">At about 2 pm that day, out first case of Jega timing was diagnosed. He didn't start at noon as he said but no one cared. He was on seat already at the INEC national coalition centre, Abuja, so it was only a matter of minutes before the results would be announcesd and we could return to our regular lives. When the live broadcast started, he apologized for the delay and he informed us that the whole process may take about 10-12 hours. We didn't mind, we were willing to wait. And so the coalition process began.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-U3cWVAhYtjU/VWxLp_uqAkI/AAAAAAAABnU/gB0tPJf64f8/s640/blogger-image--1458951625.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-U3cWVAhYtjU/VWxLp_uqAkI/AAAAAAAABnU/gB0tPJf64f8/s640/blogger-image--1458951625.jpg"></a></div></div><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">Each state had an electoral officer usually a current or former vice chancellor of a university. It was interesting seeing renowned professors and lecturers fumble in public. People had to ask if these set of people were the same people wielding the magic stick over peoples destinies in the university. It just made me appreciate the fact that no human being is perfect.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">About 14 political parties took part in the 2015 presidential elections and when&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">the results from a particular state are to be announced, the electoral officer would call out the parties with their results simultaneously, in their alphabetical order. This process took about 36 hours.&nbsp;</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">How is the winner decided?&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">1. Total number of votes&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">2. More than 25% of votes in a state</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">Before the coalition process was over, Nigerians already knew who the winner was. What a dramatic evening it was as the streets were filled with celebrations. Chants of <b><i>"sai baba, sai Buhari"</i></b> rented the air.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OcQ-moKsyuM/VWxLj8dNqQI/AAAAAAAABnE/EVxM0maLhEI/s640/blogger-image--1965811471.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OcQ-moKsyuM/VWxLj8dNqQI/AAAAAAAABnE/EVxM0maLhEI/s640/blogger-image--1965811471.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">The fireworks in the sky that night reminded me of New Year's Eve. In a bid to ensure peace, the sitting president Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, called the president-elect, Gen. Mohammed Buhari to congratulate him. That singular act by the president was welcomed by most people as a sign of peace.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uJ51XFTPRiM/VWxLmn9eveI/AAAAAAAABnM/K4kuZoM99Us/s640/blogger-image-482366643.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uJ51XFTPRiM/VWxLmn9eveI/AAAAAAAABnM/K4kuZoM99Us/s640/blogger-image-482366643.jpg"></a></div></div></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">The 2015 general elections would be a memorable one for a long time to come. With all the negativity and unfavorable circumstances that surrounded it, it still came out successful. I'm happy I witnessed it all. It's my turn to tell my grandchildren about the famous 2015 elections!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">I'll leave you with a quote from Prof. Attahiru Jega;&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TQk5foRrl2c/VWxLA_GdB4I/AAAAAAAABm0/WZQ2PEUM7Po/s640/blogger-image-90273927.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TQk5foRrl2c/VWxLA_GdB4I/AAAAAAAABm0/WZQ2PEUM7Po/s640/blogger-image-90273927.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">P.s: I do appreciate the effort put in by Channels television during the election. Period. Tremendous work!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">Picture credit: google, @bayoomoboriowo, twitter.</div></div></div>
