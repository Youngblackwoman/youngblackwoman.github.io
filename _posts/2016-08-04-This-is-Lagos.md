Dear Diary, I am a Lagosian. I just had to throw that out there so no one has second thoughts while reading this post. Anyone that has followed this Diary since it's inception in 2012 (yes, 4 years and counting) would know that I love narrating my experiences in this big city.

I was born, bred and *buttered* in the heart of Lagos, Nigeria, so if there's anyone with an unofficial license to write about this place, I guess it's me. Anytime I think I've seen it all, something comes around and still manages to leave me shocked. This series will cater to the needs of everyone that lives in Lagos: from the IJGB *(I just got back)* peeps, the newbies in town who don't know so much about this beautiful city and even the regulars like you and I who just need a little reminder of why we love Lagos.

Articles will be out on Thursday mornings just to commemorate the market environmental sanitation day. Yes, you get to read juicy stories about living in Lagos (that's after you have cleaned your environment though). I have decided to put my camera to good use so expect some pictures to go with it. I'm quite excited about his series and I can't wait to see how many of you can relate to the stories here. The mystery of this great city cannot be unraveled in one post, so I shall continue to write about my experiences here until someone out there can say "yes, I finally understand Lagos".

If you have questions or comments, please feel free to send a mail to youngblackwoman@gmail.com. You can also catch me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/yungblackwoman) or [instagram](http://instagram.com/yungblackwoman), I would love to follow you back. You can also subscribe to the Diary so you don't miss any of the post's.

Happy new Month earthlings, August will be good to us.


*Eko o ni baje, O baje ti!*
