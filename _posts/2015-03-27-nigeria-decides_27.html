<div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Dear diary,</span></div><div><br></div><div>Eku ipalemo election ooo...</div><div><br></div><div>How are you faring this election period? It's only a few hours left until Nigerians decide who will lead the country for the next four years. Are you ready to vote? I hope you have your Permanent voters card and you are ready to make your voice heard. While we count down to <b><i>#NigeriaDecides</i></b>, let's take a look at some of the words that have lost meaning to a lot of people because of how they've been overused.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-y-skkKNScQM/VRW-xno4TZI/AAAAAAAABfo/FdhZlwcwfEM/s640/blogger-image-750396069.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-y-skkKNScQM/VRW-xno4TZI/AAAAAAAABfo/FdhZlwcwfEM/s640/blogger-image-750396069.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div><b>The masses:</b> the masses this! The masses that! If I didn't know any better, I would have thought it was a family name in one village setting like that in a Nollywood movie. The masses, which in dictionary terms refers to 'ordinary people' has been overused such that even first class citizens that may never experience (even in their dreams) what the real masses are going through are also claiming masses. *sigh*</div><div><br></div><div><b>The North</b>: at first, I thought it was stories about Kanye's daughter, North, making the rounds as usual but I was wrong. Since this election brouhaha, the north had gained more publicity than it had during the days of bombings and unrest. While some people have been using the north to score cheap political points, others have made the north the butt of their jokes in recent times. Some people talk about the north as if it's one island in Mars that they'll never have anything to do with. I hope when it hits home, you'll remember that the 'north' is in your own country, right under your very nose.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Permanent voters card (PVC):</b> &nbsp;it sounds like a pass for a cool kids club. People put up pictures of their PVC's on Instagram and twitter with captions like: #GotmyPVC #readytovote #ilookcutetho #Fyngyalnopimples #Okbye i understand that it's a way of encouraging people to go get theirs but I hope these people actually make use of the card tomorrow. That's the only reason it was made, not for likes on instagram.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Violence</b>: Everyone is talking about it. So many hashtags on one word; <b><i>#sayNOtoviolence</i></b> &nbsp;<b><i>#Peacenotviolence</i></b> e.t.c. The irony of it is that some of the people trending the hashtags are also inciting violence with their words such that you have to ask yourself "errr.. What does violence mean again?!"</div><div><br></div><div><b>Election</b>: well that's the business on ground at the moment. It is the reason you are reading this post. I agree it has to be over flogged but people are taking it to far. To a child, Election now sounds like a big party where celebrities are coming to perform, like an event where there'll be paparazzi's and all. Don't get it twisted, it's the act of choosing someone for a public office by voting. Start sensitizing the young ones on it's importance now so they'll be fully aware of their rights once it's their turn to vote.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Change</b>: this particular word has to be the unanimous winner. Until November last year, the word Change didn't mean anything out of the ordinary, it was just a regular word used when you wanted your balance of transport fare paid to the conductor of a <b><i>Danfo</i></b> in Lagos. All that has changed now. Ask anybody, I mean turn to the person seated next to you and ask "what word has been used the most during this election period?" Yeah, your guess is as good as mine. One thing I'm sure of is that there'll be change when the results are announced. I just hope it'll be change for good.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Stock up</b>: this one just came in last minute. People keep shouting "stock up! Buy stuff! You don't want to go hungry." and you have to remind them that it's just an election and not the Third World War.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There you have it ladies et gents, hopefully these words would return to their actual meanings when this election season is over. Please go out and vote tomorrow, may the best man win. Don't lord your opinions over anyone. One man, one vote!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>"To keep Nigeria one, is a task that must be done!"</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b><i>Pic credit</i></b>: my able BBM contacts :)</div><div><br></div><div>P.S: please share if there are other words you feel have been overused.</div>
