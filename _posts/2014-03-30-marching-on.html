Dear diary,<br><br>The month of March is almost over. It's been a month of many feelings. A lot of things happened this month and a little recap will help us to be thankful.<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-siyEZi6HFy8/UzfqPEJn1dI/AAAAAAAAAwU/VRi92kLMSlk/s640/blogger-image--693941589.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-siyEZi6HFy8/UzfqPEJn1dI/AAAAAAAAAwU/VRi92kLMSlk/s640/blogger-image--693941589.jpg"></a><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-siyEZi6HFy8/UzfqPEJn1dI/AAAAAAAAAwU/VRi92kLMSlk/s640/blogger-image--693941589.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Zr58ZuGmm6Y/UzfwyI1NntI/AAAAAAAAAws/8JgS5TcbPFg/s640/blogger-image-371388113.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Zr58ZuGmm6Y/UzfwyI1NntI/AAAAAAAAAws/8JgS5TcbPFg/s640/blogger-image-371388113.jpg"></a></div>&nbsp;</div>The National immigration&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.bellanaija.com/2014/03/16/which-way-nigeria-tragedy-strikes-as-stampede-at-the-nigerian-immigration-service-recruitment-test-centres-claims-more-than-10-lives-minister-reportedly-states-impatience-as-cause/" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Recruitment&nbsp;</a><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">exercise&nbsp;took place on the 15th of this month in various centers across the nation. A stampede occurred in some centers and people were terribly injured while some died in the process. The minister of interior has finally taken responsibility for the mishap that day. We can only hope that the government has learnt from that tragedy and that steps would be taken to avoid such reoccurrence in future. Bereaved families were compensated with automatic employment but we know it is not enough. May God comfort them and give them peace.</span></div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-tMuRNl6Jyh0/UzdxiPrxRwI/AAAAAAAAAu0/m2ICRpYNSbw/s640/blogger-image--2036821327.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-tMuRNl6Jyh0/UzdxiPrxRwI/AAAAAAAAAu0/m2ICRpYNSbw/s640/blogger-image--2036821327.jpg"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div>Zara Gretti has gone to rest. After battling&nbsp;<a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis" style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium;">Multiple sclerosis&nbsp;</a>for over one year, she finally gave up on the 28th of March. She was a fighter and she fought to the very end. The 28 yr old singer always told the world that MS would never take her life and dreams but the Grim reaper struck when we least expected. Zara, sleep well in The Lord. There's no more pain.<br><br>The National conference is underway and we are hoping it will yield results that will move this nation forward. We have been stagnant for too long and it's important that we do something about it. Delegates were selected from all over the country to deliberate on issues bothering the nation. One of the delegates passed away after battling with an illness, may his soul rest in peace.<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uukqI7Re15g/UzdxrvYzIkI/AAAAAAAAAvE/UdCb7W2SkNY/s640/blogger-image--1216926779.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uukqI7Re15g/UzdxrvYzIkI/AAAAAAAAAvE/UdCb7W2SkNY/s640/blogger-image--1216926779.jpg"></a></div>Love is in the air!!! Marriages, proposals et all headlined the month of March. Older half of Psquare, Peter Okoye married his heartthrob; Benny Ark of Cool Fm Abuja married Ese Walter; Tinsel's Kwame Mensah proposed to Damilola Adegbite; Adanna Ohakim got married to her 'udo' and many others. I wish you all a happy married life with beautiful babies.<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vO0mFaJO8GM/UzfmA0s63rI/AAAAAAAAAv8/J_b-ezyyHxg/s640/blogger-image--1721989252.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><br><font color="#000000">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</font><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vO0mFaJO8GM/UzfmA0s63rI/AAAAAAAAAv8/J_b-ezyyHxg/s640/blogger-image--1721989252.jpg"></a></div><br>We also celebrated the Diary&nbsp;<a href="http://thediaryofayoungblackwoman.blogspot.com/2014/03/yes-she-is-2.html?m=1" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Bloggiversary</a>. Madam&nbsp;at the top celebrated her birthday and also made some changes. The Diary BBM Channel is now live (search: The diary of a young black woman) join so we can have fun. Culinary skills are getting better spreading across the 7 seas and all I can say is le rib finder is one lucky chap.<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-E_7XLZacGb8/UzflwyigcjI/AAAAAAAAAvs/8PPxImcZZJQ/s640/blogger-image--1946002636.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-E_7XLZacGb8/UzflwyigcjI/AAAAAAAAAvs/8PPxImcZZJQ/s640/blogger-image--1946002636.jpg"></a>&nbsp;<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HE7DD9y3K7g/UzfoWAvMmxI/AAAAAAAAAwI/Wc5X3vSDQAA/s640/blogger-image--228486506.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HE7DD9y3K7g/UzfoWAvMmxI/AAAAAAAAAwI/Wc5X3vSDQAA/s640/blogger-image--228486506.jpg"></a></div></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">A House of Horror was discovered in Soka, Ibadan. People that had been kidnapped since 2008 and even 4 months ago were discovered. They were fed once a week and they became week and aged fast. The house had been there since but nobody knew what was happening inside. Human skulls and remains were also found in that place. The police has started investigations and we hope that it'll yield results.</span></div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OJNc2rrfoQI/UzdxmcusiTI/AAAAAAAAAu8/hylQfcZ_OQQ/s640/blogger-image-696310674.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OJNc2rrfoQI/UzdxmcusiTI/AAAAAAAAAu8/hylQfcZ_OQQ/s640/blogger-image-696310674.jpg"></a>&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div></div>A Malaysian plane,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.malaysiaairlines.com/my/en/site/dark-site.html" style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium;">MH370</a>&nbsp;that was going to Beijing vanished into thin air. On the 8th of March, the passenger plane with 239 people on board went missing. Hearing that story sent shivers down my spine because I can only imagine the pain the relatives of the passengers must be going through. 14 days after, the Malaysian government declared that the plane plunged into the Indian Ocean. All passengers and crew in board, died. Very sad! Search is still ongoing for debris from the plane.<br><br>Other events worth recapping include the Road traffic accident on the Benin-ore highway, BokoHaram struck in some schools again, we lost veterans et many more. May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, Rest in peace, AMEN.<div><br>This recap was not done to make you feel sad but only to remind you that whatever you are going through, the fact that you are alive is enough for you to be happy. Tomorrow is another day, believe and it will work out well for you.<br><br>Our father in heaven took us through March despite all it's challenges. Marching on into April, We are trusting him for a beautiful month.</div><div><br>HAPPY NEW MONTH!!!<br><br>P.s Don't fall for the April fool pranks :)</div>
