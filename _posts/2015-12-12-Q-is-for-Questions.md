Dear diary, the long awaited letter Q is here. Not a few people were waiting to see what word letter Q would stand for, well now you know. I am going to be asking valuable questions on the blog today; questions that drive our mentality, questions that you need to personalize to answer. I hope you can answer these questions because the answers you provide, define who you are. I hope this post stimulates your heart to do the right thing after reading. If it does please don't comment, just tell me *Mission accomplished!* in the comment section.

The following questions are quite simple and should be answered in *4 minutes*. Get a note pad and answer them sincerely, the questions are all about you. Good luck!

As much as I would love to read all your answers to these questions, I totally understand if you do not want to post some of them here. These questions were asked to assess your understanding and practice of the values we are learning from the alphabetical series. They are to remind you of who you are in case you have forgotten. I'm asking you these questions today to awaken the human in you, to make you face reality, to remember where you are coming from and to take you that place where you ought to be. It's easy to lie to everyone but at least tell yourself the truth before it's too late.

In the words of one of our distinguished elders in Nollywood, *"A person who asks questions never misses his way"* **-Pete Edochie**

So ladies et gents, *Mission accomplished!* or nah?
