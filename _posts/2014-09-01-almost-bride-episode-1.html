His soothing, encouraging words were always on time and they healed even the weariest of hea</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">rts. That was what attracted her to him.</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;She remembered when she first met him. He was one of those guys in class that you would vow never to have</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;anything to do with. He was so</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;engrossed in his books that she wondered if he had a life outside the four walls of the classroom. She was smart too, a tad too much for her own liking but she had a life outside school.</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;She partied with friends on weekends</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;attending weddings and other frivolities.</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;She also had a knack for baking</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">. All these qualities and yet she still thrived at school. It was during one of her bad days as a part 2&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">m</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">edical&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">student that she met Johnson.</span></span></span></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">She was on the queue for the ATM at GTB</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">ank on a Friday and the queue was a disaster. There were two machines stationed at the entrance of the bank but one decided to stop working</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;on that fateful day. She was</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;in</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;a</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;pensive mood and her patience</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;was thinning out by the second, just then, a</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;man came to st</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">and in front of her on the queue. H</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">e wore a pair of cylindrical spectacles, he had an afro that quite admirably added to his height and he had his ears plugged into the&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">music realm because&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">apparently,&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">he did not hear when Ihuoma was trying to ask him to get to the back of the line.</span></span></span></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">Hello!”</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">Ihuoma said as she tapped his shoulder from behind.</span></span></span></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15"></span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">"Is it that you are plain stupid or your glasses are just on your face for decoration?</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">"</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;</span></span>&nbsp;</span></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">"Can't you see that there's a queue?" She kept straining her neck to look at his face as she shouted; this was certainly not one of the best times to be 5ft 5". The young man was still trying to understand what the commotion was all about but Ihuoma</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">couldn’</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">t be bothered by that. It was like she had finally found the moment to release her bottled&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">anger&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">and she wouldn't let it go like that.</span></span></span></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15"></span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">"That's how you all are, you can't do things the&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">right way.</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">Self-righteous people!

He was still looking at her with his mouth wide open and his palms opened upward as if he was saying, "what happened?" However, the words did not just come out. When somebody finally explained the scenario to him, he walked up to her and said, "I am very sorry for annoying you; it was never my intention to make you angry, please forgive me</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">.”</span></span></span></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15"></span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">It was the first time Ihuoma would hear him speak. They had been classmates all the while but it was from a distance. His baritone voice and&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">‘fo-ne’</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;accent was enough to make any young woman start smiling in a weird way. Ihuoma took one look at him and waved him away. He stood there and kept apologizing until she f</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">inally faked a smile and said, "I</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">t's okay"</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">.</span></span>&nbsp;</span></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">She did not see him again until Monday after Clinical pathology class in the afternoon.

It&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">was quite ridiculous living life by a set of rules drafted by someone who could have been depressed.</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;She had not realised this until Johnson pointed it out.</span></span></span></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">T</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">heir friendship blossomed. They would hang out after class, take long walks in the evening and when they were not doing any of those, they were on the phone chatting with each other. It was on one of such evenings that he asked her to be his girlfriend. He was quite moody that day, he did not talk much. All efforts by Ihuoma to chat him up were abortive. It was not until she pressurized him and threatened to go back to the hostel that he opened up; "Ihuoma, I like you, I like you a lot. The way you laugh at me, the way you smile, the way you call my name, it all makes me happy."</span></span></span></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">Starry-eyed, Ihuoma looked at him as he continued, "Your big eyes, the mole by the side of your nose, your beauty gives me life, Nkem.

She had been expecting this all along and now that it was official, her joy knew no bounds. Rolling her eyes at him and trying to play hard to get, she replied, "</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">W</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">hat took you so long eh?

His carriage, accent and poise took the word 'Class' to another realm. Mary, Ihuoma’s mother had bumped into his tall frame at her friend Ogechi's wedding when she was trying to enter the church. He never stopped looking at her and had to beg the bride to give him her number. He called her up the next day and stammered for about 2 minutes on the phone as he was trying to&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s5" style="font-style: italic;"><span class="bumpedFont15">explain who he was. Mary was a beauty to behold and so she was used to advances from men. She was expecting the call since Ogechi had confessed to her, what she did. She had heard all sorts from men but this was different. He was a renowned engineer but his shyness on the phone thrilled her. She laughed hard on the phone before she agreed to lunch with him at a restaurant in Ikeja. She told him she would meet him there but he would not allow it. He asked to pick her from work and then take her to the restaurant. In those days, such gestures were weird. Some men would ask you out</span></span><span class="s5" style="font-style: italic;"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;to a restaurant</span></span><span class="s5" style="font-style: italic;"><span class="bumpedFont15">, meet you there and drive off with their car (if they had one) and leave you to find your way home. He took care of her as if she was an egg. During the vote of thanks at their wedding&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s5" style="font-style: italic;"><span class="bumpedFont15">reception</span></span><span class="s5" style="font-style: italic;"><span class="bumpedFont15">, three years later, he made reference to how shy he was asking her out on a date and how she laughed at him. 25 years on and her daughter was introducing a similar man to her, how wonderful.</span></span></span></div><div class="s4" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">"Mummy, c</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">ome and take picture</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">,&nbsp;</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">we have places to go." Ihuoma had introduced Johnson to her family and now she had to go meet his. The graduation party would soon be over and that was the best day to meet them. Johnson’s parents were quite academic in dressing no wonder he had such attributes. They both wore glasses and did not talk much. They smiled at her when she greeted and that was it. It was not a rude</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;or disgusted smile; it was more like a 'W</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">e are happy, that's just how we are' smile.

It looked all superficial, n</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">othing from the heart. Its been eight</span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">&nbsp;months now, why on earth would she think that Johnson would call her on a wednesday morning out of the blues?
