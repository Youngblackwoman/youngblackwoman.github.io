*Dear diary, Happy new year! May the Joy and blessings that come with a new beginning, remain with you throughout and beyond 2016. Any new year resolutions? What new thing do you want to experience this year? What goals do you hope to achieve this year? Everything you want to achieve, can be achieved...*

That was the first part of this post I started writing on the 13th of January this year and somehow, it never got finished. I'm not going to tell you about how school got hectic, a lot of pressure, exams and so much more but what I will tell you is that I'm happy to be writing again. Amidst all the sad happenings in the country, there can't be a better time to talk about Unity. A lot has happened in the last few months (no fuel, no power, recent university protests, e.t.c), testing our patriotism and unity as a nation but through it all let us remember that it is for a good cause (I hope).

Unity is a state or quality of being one or united into a whole. As simple as this definition seems, there's a lot to take home from it. We all came into this world individually so why should you be united with strangers unneccesarily? Unity may not seem to be of any importance to you as a person when life is going smoothly but when you are pressed hard or boxed into a corner, it's value to you at that point in time cannot be overestimated. Like I mentioned in the post on [explore](http://thediaryofayoungblackwoman.com/2015-09-12-E-is-for-Explore.html), the human mind has an insatiable thirst for more. Being united in a group, organisation, e.t.c, in a way helps to quench this thirst. We get to learn a lot from each other, building each other up in the process.

*I can do things you cannot, you can do things I cannot: together we can do great things.* **-Mother Theresa**

Growing up, my siblings and I watched tales by moonlight every Sunday evening and we always had something to learn. On one of such episodes, the instructor explained the whole concept of unity to us using a broom. We were taken aback by his explanation so we went *broom hunting*. On finding one, I removed a broom stick from it and I was able to break it in the twinkle of an eye. Then my sister tried breaking the broom at once but it was impossible. Instead her palms turned red and she almost hurt herself in the process. We learnt a very valuable lesson that day; alone you can be easily broken but when you are united, you are unbreakable, it's as simple as that.

*We are only as strong as we are united, as we as we are divided.* **- J.K. Rowling**

Most times, the human mind tries to play tricks on us; that we can survive alone but the truth is that, no man is an island. Unity helps to strengthen us in our weakest moments. It has a role to play in every aspect of our lives; the family, school, work place and even the country at large. Once there is disunity, quarrels and conflicts ensue. In order to move forward, we have to be united. Take for instance, the work place. If all the employees of a particular company are united in pursuing the goal of the company instead of their own selfish interests, can you imagine the level of success that company would record? Alone, there is only so much that you can do but together, we are indestructable.

Now you may be asking, if unity has all these benefits attached to it, why is there disunity in our society today? From what I have observed in recent times, it can be a herculean task bringing people together. I mean these individuals have varying opinions, mindsets, ideologies and personalities, how can you possibly think it would be easy to unite them? Our ego and lack of vision most times, blinds our foresight and we can't look beyond our noses, at the promising future that lies in our unity.

Let's drop our personal agenda's, negative energy and maliciousness and channel our minds towards the great future our country. It's our loss if this nation falls because we have no other place to call home. Give constructive criticism, share your ideas so we can all move forward. To make Nigeria one, is a task that must be done. She will be great!


**Unity and Faith, Peace and Progress.**
