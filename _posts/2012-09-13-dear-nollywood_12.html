It’s been a while. .Yours truly has been quite busy of late but I managed to stumble on a trend on twitter…..#ThingsNollywoodTaughtME. It  basically talks about various things we’ve been made to believe as a result of the Nollywood movies that we watch. For your information, Nollywood refers to  the Nigeran movie industry  It’s just for Fun though……ENJOY!!  .#ThingsNollywoodTaughtME…..<br /><br />That the soundtrack of a movie can tell you the whole story.<br /><br />That you can carry a hair-do for 20 yrs.<br /><br />That you can actually get hit by a parked vehicle.<br /><br />That the wife of a poor skinny man is always fat.<br /><br />That all mother-in-laws’ are wicked and evil.<br /><br />That a poor farmer can afford brazilian hair.<br /><br />That when a couple can’t have a male child it’s the woman’s fault.<br /><br />That the native doctors are always poorer than those they make rich.<br /><br />That witches must always laugh during their meetings.<br /><br />That once someone is poisoned the person must scream, cough and then die.<br /><br />That all kidnappers stay in uncompleted buildings.<br /><br />That you can cry foe 1 hr without tears coming out of your eyes.<br /><br />That all long-bearded men are always evil.<br /><br />That you can hear a Nokia ringtone from a Blackberry phone.<br /><br />&nbsp;That you can shoot someone on the leg and then blood will come out of the mouth.<br /><br />That once a woman vomits, she‘s pregnant.<br /><br />That an actor does not die…. If he dies, his ghost must appear in part 2.<br /><br />&nbsp;That all poor people drink Garri  and the rich people drink juice.<br /><br />That mad people always like bread.<br /><br />That a ghost must look left and right before crossing the road.<br /><br />That poisoned food always tests better.<br /><br />That all the village elders wear the same cloth everyday.<br /><br />That you can cry with only one eye.<br /><br />That you can watch someone travel from Lagos to Ibadan.<br /><br />That you can actually SKYPE using a calabash filled with water. *LAUGHS OUT LOUD*……<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;I do hope you enjoyed it. Now its time for you to make me laugh, What has NollyWood taught YOU???? Stop looking back, I’m talking to you…yes you!!!.<br /><br />GRACIAS.
