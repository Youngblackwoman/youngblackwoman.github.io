I, 2014, am finally leaving this earth. My stay with you has been quite eventful so I don't know how you would take my departure.</div><div><br></div><div>When I came to your house that morning of January 1, you were not at home. Your neighbors told me that you went for the watch night service so I decided to wait. What's the hurry anyway? I was going to be with you for 365 long days. It seemed like eternity at that time but now it has come to an end. I notice you were happy to see me because you thought (or rather, hoped) I brought lots of goodies for you. Well that was my plan too but these things don't always happen the way we plan them.</div><div><br></div><div>Through January, Febuary, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November an even December, i watched you struggle to make the most of my stay with you. There were good times between us where you felt on top of the world and there were also bad, even terrible moments where you wished me away.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">I was there when you cried your eyes out, sitting on the floor because you were tired of me and all the bad luck you felt I brought.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Today, you are smiling as you read this speech not because my stay with you was pleasant and rosy all through, but because you heard that my younger sister is coming tomorrow. Yes, you made a lot of mistakes while I was around but I didn't say anything to you because I wanted you to pick yourself up and learn from them. You feel my sisters presence will make a difference in your life but the truth is there would be no difference if you don't plan towards what you want to achieve during her stay. I&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">saw you writing some things down on a paper last night, things you want to stop doing and things you want to start doing. Well, they look nice and all, like the perfect life I wish for you but I didn't see where you wrote (if you wrote) how you are going to achieve them. Please go back and analyse properly, the steps you would need to take to achieve them.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Hey, don't look too sad, I'm not rebuking you. I just want to make sure I leave you in the right frame of mind to receive my sister. Our father in heaven is sending my sister to you to avail you another opportunity in life. To right the wrongs made during my stay and to see how much you've learnt from the mistakes made. He was there throught my stay with and he's not going anywhere anytime soon. Anytime you feel alone, confused or just want to talk to someone, call his name and he'll be there in the twinkle of an eye.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I'm happy now to take my leave because more than anything, you've grown in age, strength and mind. You know much more than you knew when my elder sister was around. I trust you to stand firm and weather the storm that may come with my sisters stay with you. Don't expect too much from her but be rest assured she will be good to you.</div><div><br></div><div>Till I come alive in your memory some time,</div><div><br></div><div>Yours in 365 days,</div><div>2.0.1.4</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!</div>
