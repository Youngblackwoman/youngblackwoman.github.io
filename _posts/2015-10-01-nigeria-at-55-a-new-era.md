Dear Diary,

*”Buhari is here,
  Change is here,
  There is no excuse…”*

That was the mantra around town yesterday as we prepared to celebrate our dear country, Nigeria at 55. People have always found confounding; my independence posts over the years. My optimism and hope for a country that leaves little to be desired, baffles them. Like I always say, there is no other place I can call home.

The 2015 general elections took place this year. That election would go down in history as a very successful one, despite the insecurities and agitations that tried to maul it. Power was handed over to the new party in a peaceful manner and true to their mantra, *change* is here. Even though many have been perplexed at the rather dawdling pace of instilling change, we cannot deny the fact that there is something different about this government.

October 1 is not a day for us to adorn green attires and carry paper flags like football supporters. It ought to be a day for sober reflection. Even if other countries will lie to us and continue to congratulate us every year, let us be true to ourselves. Forget the fancy adverts in the papers that rise out of nowhere every October 1, where really are we heading to in this country? If you want to solve a problem, you must first identify the cause.  In celebrating our 55 years of independence, let’s look at some of the challenges we still face as a nation.

Every year, youths are churned out of the university and thrown into the labor market. It’s like a free for all, graduating people with no jobs in view. The *ginger* you have on your convocation and passing out parade slowly dies as you wake up to another day under the scorching sun with your file in hand. It takes courage and drive to go through that routine every day until you receive that all important job offer. Those who painstakingly train their wards through school, are hoping that they would reap the fruit of their labor in due time. Seeing that unemployment continues to thrive in our society, when will that *due time* come?

Corruption doesn’t seem to get tired of this *hide ‘n’ seek* game it keeps playing with Nigeria. Despite my years of training, corruption seems to be the only infective disease I know that doesn’t have an end. It cannot even be managed! It has genetic tendencies, being passed on from generation to generation. It has eaten deep into epidermis of our nation. Sometimes, I decide to be optimistic; have hope and believe that something good will come out of our young generation. Every time, my hopes are dashed when I see someone turning his neck in an exam hall to cheat. Those of you that take pride in blaming the government for our unending seed of corruption are obviously, the ones championing its growth. Who are the people in government if not individuals like you and me? What have you done to ensure that when or if you are elected into office tomorrow, you won’t cart away millions of naira meant for the development of the country? Look at the man in the mirror and answer the question, truthfully.

Just like technology, insecurity in our dear nation continues to evolve every year. From the years of assassinations, ritual killings, terrorism and to the more recent bombings, we watched as insecurities continued to take our dear ones from us. We had hoped the bombs would go away and take with it the insecurity that has come to stay but kidnapping seems to be on the rise. Men and women both young and old, are being taken away from their families in exchange for money. . When did we become this inhumane?  It’s been over 500 days since the *Chibok* girls were taken from their school in Borno state and people seemed to have moved on.

There are many other challenges that we face such as lack of social infrastructures, power, bad roads, poverty amongst others. These problems are intertwined and solving just one of them would go a long way in resolving the others. I’m not here to paint a gloomy picture of Nigeria and make you sad on this beautiful day. It’s our independence anniversary and if you think there’s nothing worth celebrating, remember that some countries would give anything to be where we are today. By all means, go out and celebrate, well aware of the change you and I must be so Nigeria can move forward. We have been the butt of jokes in recent times being called names like; the Lilliputian of Africa, suffering and smiling, a nation in reverse, *money miss road*, to mention a few. Those names do not define our beliefs. Thank God for our undying sense of humor, it has been our source of comfort in these trying times.

The President Mohammed Buhari led government, may just be the breath of fresh air that we need. On entering office, the old service chiefs and officers of the former government were shown the way out and new blood was instilled in government. Power has improved in recent times and there has been some obvious level of transparency among the government officials. The ~~surprisingly~~ low budget (70 million naira) for the independence celebration is also a sign of change. As we await the release of the ministerial list, 4 months after being sworn into office, we can only hope for the best. Slowly but surely, we’ll get there.

A new era is here, 55 isn’t too late to start the rebuilding process of our dear country. I hope that by the time we re-unite here to celebrate our 56th anniversary, some of the challenges identified, would have been tackled.  

Nigeria will be great.

**Happy Independence Day.**
