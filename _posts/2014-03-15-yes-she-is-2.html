I couldn't make up my mind on whether to write or not but seeing that you are reading it now, you can guess my decision.</div><div><br></div><div>The journey so far has been fulfilling. There were some days of blank pages in the diary and even days of epistles, still I'm thankful.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">To the diary fans (table and ceiling fans) thank you is not enough. Using your precious data to open this diary every other day makes me happy.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>It's more than a blog, it's a diary. It's for us to come and read when we are happy or sad. It provides some form of comfort and just gives me that needed smile when I'm down, I hope it does the same to you. We learn from sharing our daily experiences on this earthly journey and this diary helps to put them in writing so we can always read.</div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AAP24t1rHL4/UyQiHb_jMoI/AAAAAAAAAuY/eWtiZh1TYpQ/s640/blogger-image-1842164608.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AAP24t1rHL4/UyQiHb_jMoI/AAAAAAAAAuY/eWtiZh1TYpQ/s640/blogger-image-1842164608.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div>Starting as a zygote, it became an embryo. I nurtured it in my mind as a fetus and today, it's a 2 year old baby. I hope to train it as a child and watch it grow and blossom.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Somebody asked me when it will start going to school...lol. Keep your fingers crossed people, it just might happen.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Birthday shindig on yours truly, see y'all at Sheraton.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
