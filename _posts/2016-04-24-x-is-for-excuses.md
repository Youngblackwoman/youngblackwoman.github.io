Dear diary, I know you are laughing really hard right now but I need you to pull yourself together. No, I'm not an alumni of the school in the picture above and yes, I do know how to spell. My reasons for discussing *eXcuses* today as the value for X would be made known to you by the time you are done reading this post, so comport yourself and start reading.

"An *eXcuse* is a well planed lie!", that's what a lecturer once told a couple of my classmates that arrived 5 minutes late to his class after he asked what our *eXcuse* was. We were furious at him for telling us off in such a manner but that phrase somehow, got stuck in my head. To be honest, we had truly planned what we were going to tell him because we wanted to be ready for whatever tactics he was going to pull. He actually shut us up with that phrase because deep down, we knew what he said was true and there was no point adding salt to a fresh wound.

An *eXcuse* is one of the many reasons why a lot of us are where we are today. We already have an *eXcuse* ready for whatever life throws at us. An *eXcuse* is taking laziness to a whole new level, it is the height of irresponsibility. Why would you choose to blame something or someone for your mistakes instead  of taking full responsibility for your actions? It's like having a reason to justify our wrong choices and it shouldn't be so. It's so bad that some of us have *eXcuses* for why we woke up late, why we haven't done our assignments, why we haven't called our friends and so much more. I used to be guilty of this at a time in my life, I always had a reason (good enough for me) to not do something when I ought to and looking back now it just sounds ridiculous. I remember one *eXcuse* I believed for a while, *"It's not meant to be or it would have happened by now.",* *sigh!.* At that time, I believed the was no point pushing for something I wanted, I was just comfortable with whatever situation I found myself in. Thankfully, I know so much better now. It's better to give yourself a *no eXcuses* rule and try your best at what you are doing, than to sit back and plan good lies i.e *eXcuses.*

*"eXcuses are the nails used to build a house of failure."* **-Don Wilder**

We should take it upon ourselves to stop making *eXcuses* and ask ourselves if something can actually be done to change the situation. Don't just give up and go into your bag of *eXcuses,* looking for a new card to pull out. Even if your *eXcuse* is actually true, it becomes irrelevant at that moment because you made a conscious effort to not take responsibility for your action. There will always be a reason to not do the right thing, a reason to not go after what you want but the choice is yours to make. You can only move forward in life when you stop giving yourself reasons why it cannot work and actually give reasons why it should.

So ladies and gentlemen, what's your *eXcuse* for not sharing this post? I would like to read all about your *eXcuses* in the comment section :).

We are learning...
