Dear diary,&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-21ysgeUdfZM/Uo_vjvGhx4I/AAAAAAAAAow/8n7EkAUpJR8/s640/blogger-image-1584762886.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-21ysgeUdfZM/Uo_vjvGhx4I/AAAAAAAAAow/8n7EkAUpJR8/s640/blogger-image-1584762886.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">It's a money show around the world today. Artistes are spraying the crispy notes in their music videos like it's going out of fashion. Sugar daddies and mummies are using it to keep their partners in check and Street walkers are smiling to the bank by trading their bodies for it. Le boos' are struggling day in and out to make the money so that they can keep their girl friends and the rich husbands are trying to make more money so that they can maintain the trophy wife at home.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br></span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Those who have enough want more, those who don't have, can kill to have it. Is there an end to this search for money? Some people have died by hanging while some have been sentenced to life imprisonment all because of money. Some work all their lives, saving and economizing this precious money only to be killed in an accident, leaving the money for someone else to enjoy. Dignities have been lost and closed doors have been opened, all because of money. It's good to save money but it doesn't stop you from treating yourself right once in a while (if you can afford it). What is life about if we don't take risks?</span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br></span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Money can also be a test of true friendship. Over the years, it has been the major cause of enmity between some friends and it has also helped to unmask pretenders. People that were humble when they had nothing, suddenly become proud (with pleasure) when the money starts rolling in.</span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br></span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Being rich is not a sin after all the Holy book says it is the LOVE of money (greed) that is the root of all evil. If you can, make all the money that can be made but do share with others (orphanages, disabled people e.t.c) once in a while .</span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br></span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Here are some comparisons on what money can and cannot do. Enjoy!</span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br></span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Money can buy you a house but not a home</span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Money can buy you food but not appetite</span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Money can buy you clothes but not style</span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Money can buy you books but not brains</span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Money can buy you drugs but not health</span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Money can buy a sofa but not comfort</span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Money can buy you make-up but not beauty</span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Money can get you a woman but not a wife</span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Money can buy you a bed but not sleep....</span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br></span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">I would have said money can't buy happiness but like my friend always says "money can't buy you happiness but it's better to cry in a Bentley than in an encroached beetle".&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br></span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">I'll also like to see your tangible and intangible comparisons on what money can and cannot buy. Please share.</span></div></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br></span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Gracias.</span></div>
