Writing in this *21st century* can be such a challenging task; I have to engage you, convince you, empower you, make you laugh, comfort you, keep you intrigued and all those things you like. I do not plan to do any of the above with my entries here seeing that i started writing because my mind was becoming too small for all my ideas. I'm only going to feed you with bits and pieces of my sojourn on planet earth. If you love pictures, poetry and fiction (just like i do), then I'm sure you'll be here again.

I love reading books and I bake for fun. I live and work in a hospital so don't judge me for coming here to pen my thoughts. Please join the discussion by dropping your comments, I enjoy reading them.

Don't be a stranger, you can always say *hi* to me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/yungblackwoman) or like my [instagram](http://instagram.com/yungblackwoman) page, I would love to be your fan.
